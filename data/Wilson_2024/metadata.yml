  description: A study in the Otway Ranges to assess how Phytophthora cinnamomi has
    caused a loss of plant species, vegetation structure and fauna abundance, with
    an emphasis on Grasstrees (Xanthorrhoea spp.), keystone species.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study was conducted in the Anglesea Heathlands, an area of
    more than 7000 hectares within the Great Otway National Park, Victoria, Australia
    (Fig. 1). The underlying geology is associated with nutrient-poor soils, which
    include aeolian or outwash sands and tertiary sand/clay (Land Conservation Council
    1985). The region has a mean annual rainfall of 620.4 mm and mean temperature
    of 18.4°C (Bureau of Meteorology 2021). The heathlands are a biodiversity hotspot
    comprising over 700 plant species, equivalent to one quarter of Victoria's total
    floral diversity (Carr 2017; Wilson et al. 2020). All study sites were located
    within Ecological Vegetation Class (EVC) 48, Heathy Woodland (Victorian Government
    Department of Sustainability and Environment 2004). Heathy woodlands are typified
    by low woodland tree species, predominantly Eucalyptus obliqua (messmate stringybark)
    with a canopy to 10 m in height and average 15% cover. The understorey supports
    a diverse array of sclerophyllous shrubs and graminoids, as well as many endemic
    species, and 31% of Victoria's native orchid species. (Forster and McDonald 2009;
    Carr 2017). ^p The three sites selected for this study (Fig. 1) represent locations
    previously unsampled where there was a known infestation front, as well as uninfested
    and post-infested vegetation were, Site 1 (Edwards Creek Track); approximately
    25 metres north of Bald Hills Rd (38°22'37.6″S 144°06'41.8″E). The site occurs
    on a northern facing slope, providing favourable conditions for X. australis growth,
    and a warm and wet environment for the potential spread of P. cinnamomi. Phytophthora
    cinnamomi infestation appears closely linked with the nearby management vehicle
    track and illegal mountain biking trails.; Site 2 (Hurst Rd 1) retains a high
    density of X. australis. It is located 50 metres north-west of Hurst Rd (38°23'04.6″S
    144°13'35.4″E) on a north-west facing slope, with P. cinnamomi infestation closely
    linked with the nearby management vehicle track and mountain biking trails, developed
    by management within the Great Otway National Park. ; Site 3 (Hurst Rd 2) is situated
    200 metres east of Hurst Rd (38°23'19.7″S 144°13'31.8″E), on a southern facing
    slope. ^p Study design ^p At each of the three sites, three treatment classes
    were identified. (1) Uninfested - sites free from any symptoms of Phytophthora
    'dieback' disease, (2) Infested - sites which exhibited active 'dieback' symptoms,
    chlorotic and dead plants, (3) Post-infested - sites where there were no symptoms
    of active 'dieback', an absence of living indicator species such as X. australis
    and Isopogon ceratophyllus (horny cone-bush), and dead stumps of X. australis
    present (indicating the prior presence of X. australis on these sites). Stratified
    random sampling was implemented to independently sample within each treatment
    class and provide an accurate representation of vegetation floristics at each
    site. To align with strict hygiene protocols, all vegetation surveys were conducted
    within uninfested treatments prior to moving into infested and post-infested areas.

  methods: Due to the nature of Phytophthora spread, small quadrats (10 m x 2 m) were
    used so as to ensure each replicate quadrat fell into a single treatment category
    (no quadrats had a mix of active disease with non-diseased status, nor of active
    disease with post-diseased status). All vascular plant species present were recorded
    and identified to species level and percent cover recorded. At uninfested sites
    four 10 m x 10 m quadrats were also established and species presence recorded,
    to validate whether the 10 m x 2 m quadrats were sufficient to detect representative
    species diversity (total sample size = 105 quadrats). Susceptibility has been
    scored based on changes in species abundance/cover between sites. Species not
    scored by the author as "susceptible" have been scored as "resistant_presumed".
