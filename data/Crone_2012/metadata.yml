  description: Resistant annual and herbaceous perennial plant species were identified
    as key hosts which allow Phytophthora cinnamomi to persist on severely impacted
    black gravel sites within the Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) forest of southwest
    Western Australia.

  sampling_strategy: Selection of study sites, plant species and sampling time ^p
    Fifty-two sites were chosen in areas of the jarrah forest in southwest Western
    Australia known as black gravel sites (32°50'24.50"S; 116°03'50.65"E) where P.
    cinnamomi persists despite a substantial reduction or total disappearance of susceptible
    plant species. Characteristic for these landscapes is the presence of 60-80% gravel
    (McArthur et al., 1991) of black colour above a lateritic cemented layer with
    depressions prone to waterlogging and therefore increased chances of root infection
    (Shea et al., 1984). Previous seasonal soil sampling over a period of 2.5 years
    using the leaf baiting technique (Erwin & Ribeiro, 1996) as a detection method
    had confirmed the presence of P. cinnamomi adjacent to these sites (M. Crone,
    unpublished data). Annual and herbaceous perennial plant species in the majority
    of cases appeared to be unaffected by the presence of the pathogen and were collected
    from sites prone to temporary waterlogging following rainfall events, and from
    some free-draining sites. From these 52 sites, 19 plant species (13 annual species
    and six herbaceous perennial species) from 18 genera and 10 families were collected
    to determine whether they were hosts of P. cinnamomi. ^p Sampling was undertaken
    weekly from 28 June (winter) to 1 November 2011 (spring). To determine whether
    the pathogen remains viable within roots of infected species from the beginning
    of winter to spring, an emphasis was placed on Stylidium diuroides (herbaceous
    perennial), Chamaescilla corymbosa (herbaceous perennial) and Trachymene pilosa
    (annual) which were frequently found to be infected and were present across the
    study sites in sufficient numbers to enable repeated harvests. Not all species
    were present at each site to allow sequential weekly harvesting from a site. ^p
    During the period from 28 June to 1 November, the monthly rainfall combined (November
    excluded) was 98.7 mm below the long-term average for these months based on the
    nearest weather station in Dwellingup (Station 009538, 32.7103°S; 116.0594°E)
    (Bureau of Meteorology 2011, data not presented). ^p Sampling procedure and isolation
    method ^p Root systems were carefully removed from the soil with as many roots
    intact as possible. Each plant was shaken to remove soil particles and immediately
    transferred into a 50 mL round tub containing distilled water to remove the remaining
    soil. The majority of plants were plated in the field by drying each root system
    on a paper towel and immediately placing the whole root system onto plates of
    a Phytophthora selective medium NARPH (Hüberli et al., 2000) but without PCNB
    (1,2,3,4,5-pentachloro-6-nitrobenzene), which has been removed from the market.
    These were sealed with Parafilm and placed in an insulated box for transport to
    the laboratory.

  methods: On average, 170 individuals were collected at each sampling time until
    23 August; thereafter between 30 August to 1 November c. 56 individuals were collected
    each week. Plated roots were incubated at 21°C (±1°C) in the dark and examined
    daily for 3 days, then after 6 days, and intermittently up to 14 days. Outgrowing
    colonies were examined microscopically for morphological features typical for
    P. cinnamomi (Erwin & Ribeiro, 1996). Sites from which P. cinnamomi was recovered
    were revisited periodically and additional plants collected. A set of eight representative
    isolates from annuals and herbaceous perennials was prepared for identification
    by DNA sequencing, using the methods summarized in Aghighi et al. (2012), to confirm
    they were P. cinnamomi. Briefly, mycelium on half-strength PDA agar was harvested
    and genomic DNA extracted according to the method of Andjic et al. (2007). The
    region spanning the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) region of the
    ribosomal DNA was amplified using the primers DC6 (Cooke et al., 2000) and ITS4
    (White et al., 1990). The PCR reaction mixture and PCR conditions were as described
    previously (Andjic et al., 2007). The clean-up of products and sequencing were
    performed as described by Sakalidis et al. (2011) using the ITS4 primer.
