Graptophyllum ilicifolium",threats_long,"The main potential threats to Holly-leaved Graptophyllum arise from its restricted distribution and being confined in the landscape to narrow creek margins. Competition from introduced weeds such as Lantana (Lantana camara) could threaten the habitat and possibly allow incursion of fires due to fuel build-up (W.J.F. McDonald 2008, pers. comm., cited in TSSC 2008qf)",SPRAT profile
