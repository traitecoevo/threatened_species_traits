  description: he response to fire and rate of maturation rates of flora species in
    Western Australia's South Coast region.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Southern Prospects, the South Coast Strategy for Natural Resource
    Management, identified that the South Coast region has many fire sensitive ecosystems
    occurring on public and private land; that inappropriate fire regimes were a significant
    threatening process impacting on biodiversity; and that more information was required
    to adequately manage and conserve these systems. This project identifies a preliminary
    list of 80 fire sensitive systems and collates information on their ecological
    attributes that will directly assist their management. The response to fire and
    rate of maturation rates of flora species is documented where known.
