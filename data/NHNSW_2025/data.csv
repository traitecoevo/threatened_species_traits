Tas.Threatened species: NSW BCA: Endangered Very close to C. hebes, differing in having taller but more slender culms and leaves, with the inflorescence longer than broad and usually with fewer spikes and the utricles smaller with a longer, narrower beak. C. hebes is generally bigger in its parts than C. raleighii (except for height). The fruit inside the utricle is bigger in C. hebes and more or less truncate at the apex and obtuse at the base, whereas the fruit apex is more obtuse to broad-acute at the apex and more tapering to broad-acute at the base in C. raleighii. Fine details of the utricle also differ slightly: the wing on the neck of the utricle is slightly broader in C. hebes, and the base of the utricle is more truncate in C. hebes. However, there is not a complete correlation of characters, and further study is needed to assess whether these are two distinct species or one species that varies according to habitat.

The name 'mariae' honours Dr Mary Douglas Tindale (1920-2011), formerly a botanist with the National Herbarium of New South Wales, where she specialised in acacias and ferns. The wattle originally honouring Dr Tindale is Acacia tindaleae, but the Type specimen with that name has been found to be a minor variant of A. conferta. This makes A. tindaleae a synonym of A. conferta, however, plants from New South Wales to which the name is usually applied (as in Kodela & Harden 2002) represent a distinct species, A. mariae (see Pedley 2006).

Caladenia boweri,"Distribution and occurrence: Known by a single individual which was observed, photographed, and collected in 1988 on Mt Canobolas. This species has not been seen since, despite dedicated searching.   The only known individual grew in open Eucalyptus forest with E. macrorhycha, E. dives and E. canobolensis with a grass dominated ground layer at an altitude of 1100-1200 m in a freely draining basalt-drived loam.NSW subdivisions: CT Caladenia boweri presents an interesting case where an orchid possessing an unusual combination of characters and known by only a single individual has been described as a distinct species.  Caladenia boweri is distinct in its pink flowers, three-lobed labellum, and petals that lack clubs, while the dorsal and lateral sepals have well-defined clubs.  The three-lobed labellum and pink flowers separate C. boweri from C. fitzgeraldii, and the absence of clubs on the petals distinguishes C. boweri from C. leptoclavia, C. venusta, and a number of other spiders. Caladenia boweri shares pink flower colour and three-lobed labellum with 6 rows of calli with C. concolor  but differs by the presence of defined clubs on the sepals, the lighter colour on the petals and labellum, and perhaps by the more sharply defined marginal teeth on the labellum mid-lobe.  More observations of this species are required to establish its relationships to other spider Caladenia, and indeed confirm its continued existence in the wild.", known by a single individual which was observed photographed and collected in 1988 on mt canobolas this species has notbeen seen since despite dedicated searching   the only known individual grew in open eucalyptus forest with e macrorhycha e dives and e canobolensis with a grass dominated ground layer at an altitude of 11001200 m in a freelydraining basaltdrived loam  ,,,,,,,,,,,forest,forest,,,,,loam,loam,draining,freelydraining freelydraining

Dendrobium tetragonum,"Distribution and occurrence: Grows on rainforest trees and along streams; north from the Illawarra region.NSW subdivisions: NC, CC Other Australian states: Qld Dendrobium tetragonum comprises a range of morphotypes, and these have been formally recognised as varieties or species.  The molecular evidence available to date supports a geographic division within D. tetragonum into a northern Wet Tropics lineage, and a south-eastern lineage.  The first corresponds with larger flowered forms that have been recognised as D. tetragonum var. giganteum or D. capitisyork and D. cacatua.  The second contains D. tetragonum var. tetragonum and D. tetragonum var. melaleucaphilum.  Unfortunately, D. capitisyork and D. cacatua appear to represent extremes in clinal variation in the intensity of red pigmentation in flowers that has both altitudinal and latitudinal components, with plants from higher elevations in the southern Wet Tropics lacking red pigmentation entirely.  Similarly, while there is no doubt that plants of D. tetragonum recognised as separate taxa in south-eastern Australia differ in flower shape, size, and colour, but whether those differences reflect separate species status has not been addressed empirically.

Genoplesium ostinum is similar to G. morrisii, and differences between these two are difficult to quantify.  Jones (2001) confines G. morrisii to Victoria and Tasmania, and states that it has 'larger flowers, with much thicker segments and a broader, ovate oblong labellum with strongly developed colluviate callus' than G. ostrinum.  The Flora of Victoria gives the width of G. morrisii flowers as 'c. 9 mm', which is comparable to the width of flowers on plants from NSW.

Microtis angusii,"Distribution and occurrence: NSW subdivisions: NC, CCThreatened species: NSW BCA: Endangered; Commonwealth EPBC: Endangered When described Microtis angusii was diagnosed with reference to M. parvifolia and M. unifolia, from which it differed by its robust habit, tapering shallowly-emarginate labellum, crenulate labellum margins, and fused labellum basal calli.  The crenulate labellum margins immediately separate M. angusii from M. parviflora.  However, distinguishing M. angusii from M. unifolia is more challenging, because individuals of M. unifolia may express variation in the degree to which basal calli are fused within a single inflorescence; and the labellum apical notch may also be variably expressed.  An unpublished study (Weston et al. unpublished) found individuals with nrITS haplotypes shared with, or closely related to those possessed by M. angusii did not always express the diagnostic features associated with M. angusii.

Microtis oblonga,"Distribution and occurrence: NSW subdivisions: CC, NT, CT Other Australian states: Qld Vic. Tas. S.A. Microtis oblonga and M. rara were treated as synonyms, see for example Bates (1984) and Jones (1988 p.327 'this species is identical with M. rara'), but Bishop (1996) recognised the two species as distinct.  There are indeed two morphological forms subsumed within a broadly circumscribed M. rara, but they do not differ by the characters identified by Bishop (1996). Rather, the two morphotypes differ in the size and position of the apical labellum callus, with one  having a large, elliptical and prominantly domed apical callus that overlaps the labellum margin in the labellum's apical notch; the other has a smaller cordate to rounded callus which is distant from the sinus apex and does not overlap the labellum margin, and the plants are generally smaller in flower size and stature.  While I have not seen type specimens, the geographic distribution of these two morphotypes is compatible with the former being M. rara, and the latter being M. oblonga, which is provisionally accepted here as a result.  The occurrence of M. oblonga in New South Wales can not be confirmed on the basis of specimens held in the New South Wales Herbarium, as at 5 November 2020. Microtis oblonga could also be confused with M. unifolia but differs from that species by its widely spaced flowers at maturity, and by the long-rectangular labellum, which is around 4 times longer than broad rather than 1.5-2 times longer than broad as in M. unifolia. Microtis oblonga could also be confused with M. arenaria, but M. oblonga has the labellum apical callus distant from the labellum margin, whereas in M. arenaria the callus may overlap the margin at the apex of the deep notch in the labellum apex, the depth of this notch being another distinguishing feature of M. arenaria.  Microtis oblonga has widely spaced flowers at maturity, whereas in M. arenaria the flowers are closely spaced, as the type specimen (above) illustrates well.",   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Microtis parviflora,"Distribution and occurrence: Grows in wet places in sclerophyll forest, bogs or damp grassland, often forming extensive colonies; mainly coastal, but inland to West Wyalong district.NSW subdivisions: NC, CC, SC, NT, CT, NWS, CWS, SWS Other Australian states: Qld Vic. Tas. S.A. Microtis parviflora can be recognised by the entire, usually plane, labellum margins.  Unlike other species such as M. unifolia there are no prominantly bulging and projecting cells along the labellum margin, and it is probably best to check this character with a 20x hand lens.  The labellum shape is also fairly distinctive, in that the labellum tapers toward an obtuse to shallowly rounded apex, rather than being parallel sided or even flaring slightly toward the apex.  So, the combination of plane, entire labellum margins on a labellum that tapers toward the apex are sufficient characters for confident identification of this species.", grows in wet places in sclerophyllforest bogs or damp grassland often forming extensive colonies mainly coastal but inland to west wyalong district  ,,,,,,,damp wet,damp wet,coastal,coastal,forest_sclerophyll bog grassland,sclerophyllforest sclerophyllforest bogs grassland,,,,,,,,
Microtis rara,"Distribution and occurrence: Grows mostly in swamps or in forests in high-rainfall regions; chiefly in coastal district, west to the Blue Mtns.NSW subdivisions: NC, CC, SC, CT, ST Other Australian states: Qld Vic. Tas. W.A. S.A. Microtis rara could be confused with M. unifolia but differs by its widely spaced flowers at maturity (versus closely spaced), the long-rectangular labellum 3-4 times longer than broad (versus 1.5-2 times longer than broad), and the prominant elliptical and domed apical labellum callus, which overlaps the labellum margin at the sinus apex (versus rounded apical labellum callus which is distant from the labellum margin). Microtis rara could also be confused with M. oblonga, the two taxa share the oblong labellum and widely spaced flowers, but differ in the size and shape of the labellum apical callus.  In Microtis rara the labellum apical callus is elliptic, and overlaps the labellum margin at the labellum sinus, whereas in M. oblonga (as provisionally accepted here) the labellum apical callus is rounded to cordate, and is well separated from the labellum margin.  In herbarium material, care interpreting the degree of overlap between the callus and the labellum margin at the sinus apex is required, because the callus cells shrink when dry, and the whole callus is smaller than in life, and there may be a small separation between the labellum margin and the lower callus margin, however this is always much less than the separation in M. oblonga.  The photograph of M. rara by Wendy Grimm (above), gives you a good idea of the size, shape, and prominance of the labellum apical callus in M. rara, it also illustrates well the flower spacing on the inflorescence.

Microtis unifolia can be recognised by the combination of parallel-sided, rectangular labellum around 2 times longer than broad, whose margins are crenulate due to the presence of projecting and bulging marginal cells, usually undulate in the lower third, and whose apex is shallowly notched at most.   Microtis unifolia could be confused with M. arenaria but differs by the labellum apex being shallowly notched at most (not deeply notched); the labellum sides are parallel and the labellum does not flare slightly toward the apex (not flaring slightly); and the labellum  apical callus never overlaps the labellum margin at the apex of the notch in the labellum apex (may be overlapping in M. arenaria).  The separation ofMicrotis unifoliafrom M. angusii is challenging, the most reliable character seems to be the labellum shape, which tapers in M. angusii, but see comments on the M. angusii PlantNet page.", grows in wide varietyofhabitats from coastal swamps to rock outcrops in semiarid areas west to deniliquin district  ,,,,,,,wet semiarid,swamps semiarid,coastal rocky_outcrop,coastal outcrops,various swamp,varietyofhabitats swamps,,,,,,,,

Pterostylis major,"Distribution and occurrence: Northern New South Wales on the Northern Tablelands including the New England Tablelands and Copeland and Gloucester Tops, between 900–1400 m elevation.   In wet sclerophyll forest among shrubs and tussocks.NSW subdivisions: NT Pterostylis major is very similar to P. longifolia, both share conspicuous glaucous (blue-grey) tuberculate ornamentation on the inner synsepalum surface, lack basal flanges on the petals, have long acicular cells on the surface and especially around the margin of the labellum disc and lateral lobes, which contrasts with the unarmed labellum midlobe, and the labellum is strikingly ornate multi-coloured labellum wherein a dark brown to black-brown medial stripe contrasts with cream and green flanks (green toward the base and the margins, encircling the cream adjacent to the medial stripe) and a fawn apical region including the midlobe and lateral lobes.  Differences between P. major and P. longifolia are subtle, context dependent, and the geographic ranges of the two species may overlap which complicates identification.  Pterostylis major differs from P. longifolia in details of its labellum, best assessed in living plants.  In P. major the labellum is narrower in proportion to its length, exhibits a perceptible tapering from base to apex, and the lateral lobes are inconspicuous among the marginal cilia.  This could be because in living flowers the lateral lobes are upcurved, as is the midlobe, and the labellum outline in natural conformation is not the same as when flattened, hence the contradiction between the above and the recognition statement provided by Jones (2006), who stated that the labellum of P. major is more tapered than the labellum of P. longifolia.  The labellum markings exhibit some differences between the two species, in P. major the medial stripe is narrower relative to labellum width, and the labellum often has larger cream flanking regions than in P. longifolia.  Pterostylis major is also a larger species overall, in both stature and flower size, and labellum length (up to 7 mm long), though whether any dimension results in a discrete difference is unknown. Despite midlobe length being described as 'much-longer' in P. major the descriptions in Jones (2006) give contiguous ranges of variation, 1.0–1.3 mm in P. longifolia and 1.3–1.6 mm in P. major.", northern new south wales on the northern tablelands including the new england tablelands and copeland and gloucester tops between 900ï¿½1400 m elevation   in wetsclerophyllforest among shrubs and tussocks  ,,,,,,,wet,wets,plateaus,tablelands,forest_wet_sclerophyll shrubland,wetsclerophyllforest shrubs,,,,,,,,

Plants with shorter antrosely curved, nonglandular inflorencence hairs appear referable to the typical subspecies (Veronica sepyllifolia subsp. serpyllifolia) and are probably naturalised at both high and low elevations. Further work is required to determine the correct placement and origin of the 2 entities, and is the reason why there are naturalised and natural dots showing for the locations on the map.

Alopecurus aequalis,"Distribution and occurrence: Native of Europe, Asia and North America. The presence and distribution of A. aequalis in N.S.W. requires further investigation. There are specimens from the Cooleman Plain in Kosciuszko National Park with awns to 2 mm long attached just below the middle of the lemma at c. 2/5 of the lemma length from the base (similar to what occurs in A. aequalis specimens from overseas). There is another group of specimens, often confused with A. geniculatus, which also have inconspicuous lemma awns and these specimens are from the Yanco-Berrigan-Hay-Barham area of the South Western Plains and probably extend west to Wentworth in the South Far Western Plains. In these specimens the straight to slightly recurved or outswept awns are to 1.5 (-2) mm long and attached in the upper half of the lemma near the apex (to c. 0.5 mm or sometimes to 0.7 mm below), and the folded glumes are characteristically slightly sigmoid in shape. This group of specimens possibly represents another taxon, but the specimens have not been able to be matched with any other species of Alopecurus. Alternatively, they may simply reflect variation in A. aequalis where the lemma awn can be inserted from c. midway to subapical. This variation also occurs in Vic., where specimens with awns inserted higher on the lemma (as in most south-western N.S.W. specimens) mainly come from the north-west of the State, fide N.G. Walsh (pers. comm.). There is also the possibility for hybrids between A. aequalis and A. geniculaltus (= A. xhaussknechtianus Asch. & Graebn.). Grows in wet places such as swampy areas, creeks and irrigation channels; often aquatic with partly submerged stems.NSW subdivisions: *ST, *SWP, ?SFWP Other Australian states: *Vic. *S.A. In Alopecurus aequalis the lemma awn is only slightly exserted beyond the lemma and glumes, and is therefore less conspicuous than in the other three taxa occurring in Australia. It is similar to, and has been confused with, the more common Alopecurus geniculatus, but distinguished from it by having glumes about equal or slightly shorter than the lemma, lemma margins connate for at least 1/3 of their length and the lemma awn usually 2 mm long or less, not conspicuously protruding beyond glumes and more or less straight. See also Kodela, Cunninghamia 15: 143-151 (2015).", native of europe asia and north america the presence and distribution of a aequalis in nsw requires further investigation there are specimens from the cooleman plains in kosciuszko national park with awns to 2 mm long attached just below the middle of the lemma at c 25 of the lemma length from the base similar to what occurs in a aequalis specimens from overseas there is another group of specimens often confused with a geniculatus which also have inconspicuous lemma awns and these specimens are from the yancoberriganhaybarham area of the south western plainss and probably extend west to wentworth in the south far western plainss in these specimens the straight to slightly recurved or outswept awns are to 15 2 mm long and attached in the upper half of the lemma near the apex to c 05 mm or sometimes to 07 mm below and the folded glumes are characteristically slightly sigmoid in shape this group of specimens possibly represents another taxon but the specimens have notbeen able to be matched with any other species of alopecurus alternatively they may simply reflect variation in a aequalis where the lemma awn can be inserted from c midway to subapical this variation also occurs in vic where specimens with awns inserted higher on the lemma as in most southwestern nsw specimens mainly come from the northwest of the state fide ng walsh pers comm there is also the possibility for hybrids between a aequalis and a geniculaltus = a xhaussknechtianus asch  graebn grows in wet places such as swampy areas creeks and irrigation channels often aquatic with partly submerged stems  ,,,aquatic,aquatic,,,wet,swampy wet,plains,plains,aquatic streams plains swamp,aquatic creeks plains swampy,,,,,,,,

Natural hybrids between the 2 genera are uncommon, even where both genera are native. Man-made hybrids between the 2 genera are becoming increasingly important as cereal crops. These hybrids often have a complex ancestry involving multiple hybridisations, backcrossings and artifically-induced chromosome doubling. The genetic material in some cultivars is derived almost entirely from Triticum, whereas in others it is almost entirely from Secale, with most falling in between these 2 extremes. Beacuse of the varied and complex ancestry of different X Triticosecale hybrids, it is best to treat the cultivars as such. e.g. X Triticosecale cv. 'Tahara' or X Triticosecale cv.

Established garden escape, which appears to be spreading. Evidence indicates human activity being the source of its introduction. For details on introduction see Kodela et al. (2014). Distinguished from other species of Lysimachia in N.S.W. by the slightly fleshy, often narrowly spathulate leaves, and flowers with white petals with apex acute to obtuse (petals more broadly rounded in L. fortunei; petals yellow in L. japonica and L. vulgaris var. davurica).

Lysimachia vulgaris var. davurica,"Distribution and occurrence: rare in Australia; recorded in several wetlands, including Wingecarribee Swamp (between Robertson and Moss Vale), a swamp/pond system in the Lower Boro - Braidwood area, and a lagoon near Bega. It  has been found (but possibly no longer occurs) on the Northern Tablelands in a New England Tablelands (Bioregion) fen SW of Walcha and also known from a single 1898 collection from Timbarra E of Tenterfield (J.T. Hunter & D. Bell, Cunninghamia 11: 49-64, 2009). The Australian populations are far disjunct from the main natural range of this taxon in NE Asia where it occurs from Japan W to Mongolia and eastern Russia. Its occurrence in Australia may provide evidence supporting long-distance dispersal; in this case the agency is likely to have been migratory waterbirds, such as Latham's (Japanese) Snipe, which visit Australian wetlands in the summer. Habitat: grows in moist situations, including peatland swamps, stream banks and lagoons. Grows in damp soils to saturated peat, in sedgeland and wet heath communities, associated with Phragmites australis, Carex spp., Juncus spp., Bolboschoenus fluviatilis, Lycopus australis, Lythrum salicaria, Leptospermum spp. and Melaleuca ericifolia.

One of the distinctive characters of Cheilanthes lasiophylla is the long, branched hairs, which occur on the upper and lower suface of the lamina, and on the stipe and rachis.  Establishing whether or not the hairs branch is challenging, because they are often close-set, overlapping, and refract light, all of which obscure hair form.  Definitive assessment of hair morphology and branching may, sometimes, only be possible when the hairs have been removed and slide mounted for examination on a compound microscope.  In any event, the hairs should always be removed for inspection.  Placing a clump of removed hairs in a few drops of water, and stirring them around or smearing them gently on a surface may sufficiently isolate individual hairs such that their form can be ascertained with a decent hand lens.", occurs across much of australia and new south wales but is rare or absent from the eastern side of the great dividing range in our state   on rocky outcrops and hills in inland arid regions  ,,,,,rare,rare,arid,arid,hills rocky_outcrop,hills outcrops,,,,,,,soil_rocky,rocky,,

Galium curvihirtum,"Distribution and occurrence: Grows in moist shaded sites in open sclerophyll forest on granite.NSW subdivisions: ?NT Other Australian states: Vic. S.A. I had a good look at that specimen (S. Griffith 6061.3) together with material of G. curvihirtum a few weeks ago as it is a new record for NSW and needed to be written up for Flora Online. I came to the conclusion that morphologically it fits within the range of variation shown by G. curvihirtum specimens at NSW. I realise it is a long way out of the known range of G. curvihirtum, which raises questions as to how it got there/persisted there. I have a sneaking suspicion that it may have been transported, possibly in wheel arch mud, given the occurrence beside a road in a State Forest. Galium species are quite good travellers e.g. on migrating waterbirds and the fruits of G. curvihirtum with their stiff hooked hairs are certainly good candidates for animal/vehicle dispersal. The original identification of S. Griffith 6061.3 as “possibly” G. curvihirtum was indeed made here at NSW, and I would confirm that ID. Of course it is possible that further material may turn up that contradicts this ID, but on the basis of the available material I am confident it is G. curvihirtum. Dr Darren M Crayn.

Acer negundo,"Distribution and occurrence: Widely cultivated, occasionally naturalised, especially in cooler districts (e.g. around Canberra and the tablelands); also in the Sydney region. Native of America. Acer negundo tolerates frost, full sun, shade (once established), air pollution and flooding, as well as drought to some extent. It has become an invasive weed along watercourses (e.g. in riparian vegetation on riverbanks) and in wet forests and woodland, as well as along roadsides and other disturbed open sites with moist soil.NSW subdivisions: *CC, *NT, *SWS, *ST Other Australian states: *Vic. *S.A. Formerly in Aceraceae. Box-elder Maple was introduced as an ornamental tree, being widely planted in parks, gardens and streets. The possible earliest records of it being naturalised in Australia are from riverbanks of the Nepean River in the Sydney Basin, from c. 1959 onwards. It appears to have been naturalised around Armidale prior to 1975. Acer pseudoplatanus (Sycamore Maple), a native of Europe, is also sometimes naturalised but differs from A. negundo in having simple, palmately lobed leaves (with 3-5 lobes). Fraxinus species (the ashes), with compound leaves, differ from Acer (the maples) in having single samaras, i.e. the single-winged fruits are not fused as they are in Acer where they are arranged in pairs forming a V-shaped fruiting body.

Tribulus micrococcus,"Distribution and occurrence: Grows especially on clay and loam soils in inland districts; also in disturbed situations; north from Wagga. Barker (2013; Flora of Australia vol. 26) suggests that it may not be native, pointing out that similar plants are found elsewhere (e.g. T. kaiseri in northern Africa). This needs further investigation. NSW subdivisions: NC, CC, NT, CT, NWS, CWS, SWS, NWP, SWP Other Australian states: Qld N.T. S.A. Probably native; patchy distribution records may be owing to previous confusion with T. terrestris.  This species often has longer branches than T. terrestris and T. minutus. Specimens with smaller flowers (petals c. 5 mm long), longer spines and shorter style may represent a separate taxon.", grows especially on clay and loam soils in inland districts also in disturbed situations north from wagga barker 2013 flora of australia vol 26 suggests that it may notbe native pointing out that similar plants are found elsewhere eg t kaiseri in northern africa this needs further investigation   ,,,,,,,,,,,disturbed,disturbed,,,,,clay loam,clay loam,,
