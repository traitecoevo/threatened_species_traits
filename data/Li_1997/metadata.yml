  description: Analysis of leaf waxes from juvenile and adult leaves from natural populations of all Eucalyptus species from the informal subgenus Symphyomyrtus native to the island of Tasmania.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: leaf age class
  sampling_strategy: Sample collection. Leaf samples were collected from natural forests throughout the island of Tasmania (40°40' to 43°40'S, and 144°40' to 148°20'E) between May and November, 1989 (Table 2 and Fig. 1), when seasonal variation was minimal (Li, 1993). At each locality, a species collection comprised a pooled sample of morphologically adult leaves collected from 15 to 20 reproductively mature trees and a pooled juvenile leaf sample collected from 15 to 20 juvenile plants from the same area. Fresh leaf samples were sealed in plastic bags and kept cool until returned to the laboratory. The samples were stored at 4'~C and processed within two weeks of collection.

  methods: Sample preparation and wax extraction. Mature leaves (excluding the previous
    year's) from each sample were removed from branches and the lamina (petiole was
    excluded) cut into 2 cm 2 pieces and well mixed. A 25 g sample of leaf pieces
    was collected for wax extraction, and a separate 100g sample prepared and dried
    to constant weight at 50°C for moisture content determination. Each 25 g sample
    of fresh leaf material was placed in a glass flask, 30 ml of pure hexane added
    and the flask shaken at room temperature for 1 5 rain, a process repeated three
    times for each sample with the three solutions combined and filtered. The hexane
    extract of each sample was then concentrated using a rotary evaporator, transferred
    into a pre-weighed, labelled glass vial, and evaporated at room temperature until
    dry. The individual vials containing dried waxes were weighed and the weight of
    dried waxes obtained by subtraction. The wax yield for each sample was calculated
    on a dry wt basis (gg-1). Qualitative analysis. The crude wax samples were analysed
    by combined GC-MS using a HP-5890 GC directly coupled to a VG 707F mass spectrometer
    with a 2035 data system. The GC column was a 12mxO.32mmx0.171~m film thickness
    Hewlett Packard (HP1), cross linked methyl-silica capillary column (SGE Pty Ltd);
    a SGE on-column-injector was used. The oven temperature was programmed to go from
    30 to 240°C at a rate of 30°Cmin -1, 240 to 300°C at 6°Cmin 1 and then to hold
    at 300°C for 3min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 70kPa with a flow rate
    of approximately 2mlmin 1. Individual compounds were tentatively identified using
    published reference mass spectra (Stenhagen et al., 1974) and an "in-house" library
    of reference spectra built up from standard compounds and those separated from
    leaf waxes of selected eucalypt species (E. globulus, E. nitens, E. delegatensis,
    E. obliqua and E. coccifera) in a previous study (Li, 1993). A pilot study involving
    the later species indicated no difference in chemical composition between cut
    and uncut fresh leaves (Li, unpubl, data). Quantitative Analysis. To obtain relative
    peak areas for individual compounds, the crude wax samples were run under identical
    GC conditions, using a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) on a HP5890 Gas Chromatograph.
