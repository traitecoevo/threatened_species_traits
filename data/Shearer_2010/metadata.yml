  description: Variation in susceptibility to Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands infection
    within the genus Lambertia was evaluated by soil and stem inoculation.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: Experimental design ^p Dependant variables for soil inoculation
    were %plants with collar lesion or %mortality. Independent variables were plant
    taxa (Table 1) in a shadehouse environment. Included for comparison within taxa
    were two populations of L. echinata subsp. citrina Hnatiuk, L. echinata subsp.
    occidentalis, L. multiflora Lindl. var. multiflora, L. multiflora var. darlingensis
    Hnatiuk and L. orbifolia subsp. Scott River Plains (Table 1). Taxa were blocked
    with three replicates. There were six plants per pot and 1-11 pots per replicate,
    depending on seed availability. Details of the shadehouse environment were as
    described in Shearer et al. (2007b). ^p Dependant variables for stem inoculation
    were visible lesion length and girdling and length of colonisation. Independent
    variables were plant taxa (Table 1) in a glasshouse environment. Taxa were in
    randomised blocks with 10 replicates. Each replicate was a single plant per pot.
    ^p Inoculation ^p Details on the method and testing of soil inoculation were as
    given in Shearer et al. (2007b). Plants (Table 1) were propagated from seed collected
    for the present study or for long-term storage in the Department of Environment
    and Conservation's Threatened Flora Seed Centre (Cochrane et al. 2007). The exception
    was L. echinata R.Br. subsp. echinata which was propagated from cuttings taken
    from natural populations because of lack of available seed. Cuttings were propagated
    as described by Close et al. (2006) and grown in pots and potting mix similar
    to those for germinated seeds. Soil was inoculated with inoculum plugs colonised
    with three isolates of P. cinnamomi, one isolate per plug, as described by Shearer
    et al. (2007b). Sufficient seed was available to inoculate pots containing at
    least 6-month-old plants of 17 Lambertia taxa in mid-summer (February) of 2004.
    Seed was available to soil-inoculate at least 6-month-old plants of L. ilicifolia
    Hook., L. fairallii and L. rariflora Meisn. subsp. rariflora in mid-summer of
    2006 and cuttings of L. echinata subsp. echinata were available for soil inoculated
    in mid-summer of 2007. Table 1 gives the number of plants that were soilinoculated
    per each taxon. Sterile pine plugs were placed in control pots containing plants,
    similar to inoculated pots. All taxa were stem-inoculated in November 2004. Stems
    of 18-month-old plants were wound-inoculated with P. cinnamomi isolate WAC12892,
    by using methods previously described (Shearer et al. 1987a, 1987b, 1988). Isolate
    WAC12892 was chosen because it was a virulent isolate from the Bell Track infection
    in the Fitzgerald River National Park, near the main centre of richness of Lambertia
    taxa (Gibson et al. 1997) and used in previous studies (Shearer and Crane 2003;
    Shearer et al. 2004, 2007b). An agar disk containing mycelium of WAC12892 was
    bound to a fresh cut in the phloem. Control stems were inoculated in a similar
    manner with sterile agar disks. ^p Assessment ^p Air and soil temperatures were
    measured in the shadehouse with WatchDog weather stations (Spectrum 2006). For
    stem inoculation, temperature was recorded with two maximum- minimum mercury thermometers
    in the middle and on each side of the glasshouse. Daily maximum and minimum temperatures
    were recorded during the inoculation period. Plants with a collar lesion and those
    dead were recorded thrice weekly for 5 months after inoculation. Plants were scored
    as dead when terminal buds and leaves were irreversibly flaccid or dried, by which
    time stem collars were girdled by lesions of the pathogen (Shearer et al. 2007b).
    Infection was confirmed by plating collar and root pieces onto selective medium
    (Shearer and Dillon 1995). Fourteen days after stem inoculation, the bark of harvested
    stems was carefully scraped from the lesion margins above and below and at each
    side of the inoculation point. Visible lesion length above and below the inoculation
    point and the circumference of the lesion and the stem diameter at the point of
    inoculation were measured. Tangential spread at the inoculation point was estimated
    in degrees. For determination of colonisation, the stems above and below the inoculation
    point were cut into 0.5-cm-long sections along the lesion, and extending 10 cm
    into apparently healthy tissue. Healthy tissue was cut and plated first, with
    utensils sterilised between cuts and plating. Sections were plated onto half-strength
    potato-dextrose selective medium (Shearer and Dillon 1995). Plated sections were
    incubated in the dark at 25ºC for 2 days and the number infected with P. cinnamomi
    was determined. Colonisation was the length of section infected with P. cinnamomi.

    = Kmax + (100 - t1/2K) + (100xr).
