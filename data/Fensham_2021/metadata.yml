  description: Extensive survey that predicts the imminent extinction of 16 rainforest
    tree species in the wild due to myrtle rust within a generation. A further 20
    species may be at risk, but further monitoring is required to determine their
    fate.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The myrtle rust symptoms of total of 1901 populations of 145
    Myrtaceae tree species at 936 rainforest locations across eastern Australia  were
    assessed to determine the impact of myrtle rust and assess the  extinction threat
    of the disease for individual species. A population is  defined as a stand of
    a tree species at least 500 m from another stand of  that tree species. Populations
    were located using herbarium specimen  data (CHAH, 2019), but incidental populations
    were also located by  visiting poorly known rainforest areas.  The disease most
    typically affects growing shoots but is only intermittently active and assessment
    of active symptoms is not always  possible. In order to assess the cumulative
    patterns of infection, inde pendent scores for minor branchlet death (medium-term,
    i.e. 1-2 year)  and, major branch and trunk mortality (long term damage) were  recorded.
    The percentage of minor branches dead was recorded as,   0 0%, 1 0-<10%, 2 10-<50%
    3 50-<90%, 4 90-100%. The percentage of  major branches dead was recorded as,
    0 0%, 1 0-<10%, 2 10-<50% 3  50-<90%, 4 90-100%, 5 100% but epicormic re-shooting
    from base or  root suckering present, 6 100%, without any sign of reshooting.
    These  scores were averaged for a minimum of ten individuals of any particular  species,
    but in some cases there were less than this number of individuals  present. These
    'population scores' for medium- and long-term damage  were averaged across all
    populations and then added together to provide  a 'damage score' for each species.
    Our determination of a Category X  species is where this damage score is above
    five. This corresponds to a  tree where the woody parts are mostly dead. Category
    Y species have  cumulative damage scores between 3.2 and 5.1. ^p  Reproductive
    capacity in relation to myrtle rust infection was  recorded and inferred across
    populations as 1) moderate, flowers and/or  fruit observed without rust; 2) low,
    flowers and/or fruit observed, but  infected with rust; 3) very low, fruit with
    viable seed never observed. Rainforest trees flower and fruit sporadically (Floyd,
    1989) and where  observations are limited reproductive capacity was recorded as
    Data  deficient. Interviews with seed collectors and horticulturalists confirmed  that
    infection of developing fruit inhibits seed development.

  methods: The disease most typically affects growing shoots but is only intermittently
    active and assessment of active symptoms is not always possible. In order to assess
    the cumulative patterns of infection, independent scores for minor branchlet death
    (medium-term, i.e. 1-2 year) and, major branch and trunk mortality (long term
    damage) were recorded. The percentage of minor branches dead was recorded as,
    0 0%, 1 0-<10%, 2 10-<50% 3 50-<90%, 4 90-100%. The percentage of major branches
    dead was recorded as, 0 0%, 1 0-<10%, 2 10-<50% 3 50-<90%, 4 90-100%, 5 100% but
