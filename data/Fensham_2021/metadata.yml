  description: Extensive survey that predicts the imminent extinction of 16 rainforest tree species in the wild due to myrtle rust within a generation. A further 20 species may be at risk, but further monitoring is required to determine their fate.

  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The myrtle rust symptoms of total of 1901 populations of 145 Myr taceae tree species at 936 rainforest locations across eastern Australia  were assessed to determine the impact of myrtle rust and assess the  extinction threat of the disease for individual species. A population is  defined as a stand of a tree species at least 500 m from another stand of  that tree species. Populations were located using herbarium specimen  data (CHAH, 2019), but incidental populations were also located by  visiting poorly known rainforest areas.  The disease most typically affects growing shoots but is only inter mittently active and assessment of active symptoms is not always  possible. In order to assess the cumulative patterns of infection, inde pendent scores for minor branchlet death (medium-term, i.e. 1-2 year)  and, major branch and trunk mortality (long term damage) were  recorded. The percentage of minor branches dead was recorded as,   0 0%, 1 0-<10%, 2 10-<50% 3 50-<90%, 4 90-100%. The percentage of  major branches dead was recorded as, 0 0%, 1 0-<10%, 2 10-<50% 3  50-<90%, 4 90-100%, 5 100% but epicormic re-shooting from base or  root suckering present, 6 100%, without any sign of reshooting. These  scores were averaged for a minimum of ten individuals of any particular  species, but in some cases there were less than this number of individuals  present. These 'population scores' for medium- and long-term damage  were averaged across all populations and then added together to provide  a 'damage score' for each species. Our determination of a Category X  species is where this damage score is above five. This corresponds to a  tree where the woody parts are mostly dead. Category Y species have  cumulative damage scores between 3.2 and 5.1. ^p  Reproductive capacity in relation to myrtle rust infection was  recorded and inferred across populations as 1) moderate, flowers and/or  fruit observed without rust; 2) low, flowers and/or fruit observed, but  infected with rust; 3) very low, fruit with viable seed never observed.  Rainforest trees flower and fruit sporadically (Floyd, 1989) and where  observations are limited reproductive capacity was recorded as Data  deficient. Interviews with seed collectors and horticulturalists confirmed  that infection of developing fruit inhibits seed development.
