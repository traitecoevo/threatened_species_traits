Rhodomyrtus psidioides (Myrteae),X,7.5 (55),−33.5° to −25.7°,Very low,"Formerly widespread; once a common, small tree along the fringe of littoral rainforest, in wet eucalypt forest and in secondary forest after rainforest clearing (J. Halford, pers. comm. 2020). Progressive decline has been documented (Carnegie et al., 2016; Fensham et al., 2020), but since 2020, three of the relatively healthy populations have collapsed with mature trees reduced to suckers. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild. Nursery grown plants are impacted but some survive (J. Halford, pers. comm. 2020)."
Lenwebbia sp. Main Range (Myrteae),X,7.4 (4),−28.3° to −27.9°,Very low,"Confined to high altitude, cool subtropical rainforest along cliff edges, where it was previously locally abundant (L. Weber, pers. comm. 2020). Ten previous populations had reliable locality data, but no live plants were located at four of these populations during our surveys of 2020. All remaining populations exhibit severe decline. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild."
Rhodamnia spongiosa (Myrteae),X,6.6 (27),−24.6° to −11.7°,Very low,"While often common where it occurs, the extreme susceptibility of R. spongiosa to myrtle rust infection has resulted in population decline across its entire range, as well as an inability to produce reproductive material. Dead and dying mature trees up to 20 m tall have been observed. Also occurs in Papua New Guinea, where the status of populations is unknown. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild."
Rhodamnia rubescens (Myrteae),X,6.3 (79),−35.7° to −26.0°,Low,"Formerly a common pioneer species in wet eucalypt forests (Floyd, 1989), but also in primary rainforest and in secondary forest after rainforest clearing (J. Halford, pers. comm. 2020). Exhibits some variation in its susceptibility to myrtle rust infection, with a small proportion of plants showing only minor stem dieback. However, formerly healthy plants have subsequently succumbed to the disease. The production of viable fruit or seedlings has rarely been recently observed within its natural range and habitat. Dead and dying mature trees up to 20 m tall have been observed (2016). Seedlings have not been observed in the wild. Nursery grown plants are impacted but some survive (S. Shaw, J. Halford, pers. comm. 2021)."
Lenwebbia lasioclada (Myrteae),X,6.3 (5),−17.8° to −16.4°,Data Deficient,"Restricted to an altitudinal range of 1000–1550 m in montane tropical rainforest, where it was formerly locally common (S. McKenna, pers. comm. 2020). Considerable population decline has been observed, including mature tree death. Reproductive material has not been recorded for this species. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild."
Rhodamnia pauciovulata (Myrteae),X,6.3 (17),−26.8° to −20.1°,Very low,"Eight populations of this species had reliable locality data, but no live plants were located at three of these populations during our surveys of 2020. All remaining populations exhibit severe decline. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild."
Rhodamnia glabrescens (Myrteae),X,6 (16),−24.6° to −20.2°,Moderate,"Occurs in subtropical and dry rainforest as a shrub or small understory tree. Tree death has rarely been observed throughout its range. Nevertheless, moderate to severe stem dieback is frequently recorded, as is reduced reproductive capacity. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild. Nursery grown plants are impacted but some survive (J. Radford-Smith, pers. comm. 2020)."
Lenwebbia sp. Blackall Range (Myrteae),X,5.9 (8),−26.8° to −26.4°,Low,"The preferred habitat of this species is swamp forest around the margins of rainforest, where it was once locally abundant (G. Thomas, pers. comm. 2020). Three population extinctions have been recorded for this species since the introduction of myrtle rust, with other populations containing only several individuals. Two forms of this species exist, and observations show that they differ in their susceptibility. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild. The impact on nursery grown plants is variable depending on provenance (S. Shaw, G. Thomas pers. comm. 2021)."
Gossia hillii (Myrteae),X,5.9 (50),−30.2° to −16.2°,Low,"A previously widespread species, occurring in tropical, subtropical and dry rainforest communities. Described by Floyd (1989) as common in dry rainforest throughout the subtropics. There appears to be negligible variation in susceptibility to infection throughout its range, with all populations exhibiting moderate to severe stem dieback. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild. Nursery grown plants are impacted but some survive (J. Halford pers. comm. 2020)."
Gossia lewisensis (Myrteae),X,5.8 (12),−16.6° to −16.1°,Data Deficient,"Formerly a common understory tree or shrub (S. McKenna, pers. comm. 2020) in montane rainforest (>850 m). Repeated assessments over three years at Mt. Lewis National Park indicate continual population decline (S. McKenna pers. comm. 2020). Seedling recruitment was recorded in only one instance across all assessment sites."
Backhousia hughesii (Backhousieae),X,5.7 (4),−17.3° to −15.9°,Low,"An uncommon species which occurs in tropical rainforest as a canopy or sub-canopy tree. Assessments indicate that this species is extremely susceptible to myrtle rust, with observations of extensive canopy defoliation and tree mortality at various sites. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild."
Rhodamnia maideniana (Myrteae),X,5.7 (13),−28.9° to −28.0°,Moderate,"A shrub or small tree, formerly locally abundant in subtropical rainforest (L. Weber, pers. comm. 2020). Assessments of two populations during the 2020 fruiting period indicated a 95% reduction in seed production (J. Radford-Smith, unpublished data). Dead and dying mature trees up to 7 m tall have been observed. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild. Nursery grown plants are severely impacted (J. Radford-Smith, J. Halford pers. comm. 2020)."
Ristantia pachysperma (Kanieae),X,5.6 (7),−17.5° to −16.1°,Data Deficient,"This species occupies lowland rainforest on the margins of freshwater swamps. Occasionally a dominant canopy tree, extensive defoliation due to myrtle rust has been observed, impacting both seedlings and adult trees. Nursery grown plants are not impacted (P. Jobson, pers. comm. 2021)"
Gossia inophloia (Myrteae),X,5.3 (11),−27.3° to −26.2°,Low,"Grows in and on the margins of subtropical rainforest and is largely restricted to small vegetation remnants. While fruit has been observed for this species, viable seed production has reduced substantially due to myrtle rust. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild. Nursery grown plants are severely impacted (Morin et al., 2012)."
Rhodomyrtus pervagata (Myrteae),Y,5.1 (34),−19.0° to −15.7°,Moderate,"In upland tropical rainforest, but also a pioneer in secondary forest (Zich et al., 2020). While a very common species, it is highly susceptible to myrtle rust infection, and experiences moderate to severe stem dieback. Unaffected reproductive material is uncommon."
Rhodamnia arenaria (Myrteae),X,5.1 (3),−13.9° to −12.7°,Data Deficient,"Most records of this species are from rainforest in the McIlwraith Range (−13.71, 143.36), for which access has become restricted. The three populations in Iron Range (−12.71, 143.26), indicate that this species is highly susceptible to myrtle rust infection, with most plants suffering severe stem dieback. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild."
Rhodamnia sp. Glastonbury (Myrteae),Y,5.1 (15),−26.8 to −25.2,Moderate,"Occupies a narrow distribution and occurs in heavily fragmented habitat. Assessments indicate that this species is highly susceptible to myrtle rust. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild. Occasional individuals have been observed producing unaffected fruit. Nursery grown plants are impacted but some survive (J. Halford, pers. comm. 2020)."
Gossia punctata (Myrteae),X,5 (19),−29.0° to −25.8°,Low,"Uncommon in subtropical and dry rainforest as a small to medium-sized tree (Floyd, 1989). Throughout the range of this species, myrtle rust impacts range from moderate stem dieback to tree death. Observations during the 2020 fruiting period indicate that seed production capacity has been severely limited, with records of up to 99% fruit abortion due to myrtle rust lesions. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild."
Rhodamnia dumicola (Myrteae),Y,4.9 (29),−28.1° to −24.3°,Moderate,"Occurs in dry rainforest as a shrub or small tree. Populations in wetter, eastern areas show more severe myrtle rust impacts than those in drier, western rainforest. This species can still produce viable seed, although seedlings have not been observed in the wild. Nursery grown plants are impacted but many survive (J. Radford-Smith, pers. comm. 2020)."
Rhodamnia angustifolia (Myrteae),Y,4.9 (1),−24.2°,Low,"Known only from one location, where it grows as a subcanopy tree in dry rainforest. Due to its rarity, only five individuals were assessed, with each showing moderate stem dieback. No seedlings were observed."
Gossia myrsinocarpa (Myrteae),Y,4.8 (41),−20.8° to −13.4°,Data deficient,"A very common shrub and small tree in tropical rainforest, with small saplings often observed in the understory. Impacts of myrtle rust are variable. Seedlings occasionally observed."
Gossia shepherdii (Myrteae),Y,4.7 (13),−19.2° to −15.7°,Data deficient,"A shrub or small tree which favours dry rainforest. Largely restricted to small saplings in the understory, yet assessments reveal that mature plants are moderately to severely impacted by myrtle rust. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild."
Rhodomyrtus canescens (Myrteae),Y,4.6 (11),−17.7° to −16.2°,Moderate,"A shrub favouring wet eucalypt forest, canopy gaps in rainforest and secondary forest. Assessments indicate that this species exhibits moderate stem dieback due to myrtle rust infection. Seedlings rarely observed in the wild."
Decaspermum humile (Myrteae),Y,4.5 (84),−33.3° to −10.7°,Moderate,"A widespread species, occurring in subtropical and tropical rainforest as a small to medium-sized tree. Populations throughout the subtropics are mostly highly susceptible to myrtle rust, whereas those in the tropics show greater resilience. Nursery grown plants are severely impacted, but some provenances, including one from the sub-tropics, survive (Morin et al., 2012; S. Shaw, pers. comm. 2021)."
Gossia macilwraithensis (Myrteae),Y,4.2 (6),−16.0° to −13.5°,Data deficient,"Uncommon throughout northern Queensland, where it grows as an understory tree in tropical rainforest. Assessments indicate that this species experiences moderate stem dieback from myrtle rust. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild."
Gossia gonoclada (Myrteae),Y,4.1 (9),−27.8° to −27.5°,Moderate,"Uncommon over a very narrow distribution, with populations rarely consisting of more than five individuals. Susceptibility to myrtle rust varies from minor to severe stem dieback. Seedlings have not been observed in the wild. Nursery grown plants are impacted but some survive (J. Halford, pers. comm. 2020)."
Lenwebbia prominens (Myrteae),Y,4.0 (11),−28.6° to −28.0°,Moderate,"Shrub or small tree in subtropical rainforest, commonly growing beside watercourses (Floyd, 1989). Assessments show that this species still produces viable seed, although reproductive capacity has reduced by up to 90% in some instances (J. Radford-Smith, unpublished data). Seedlings rarely observed in the wild. Nursery grown plants are impacted but some survive (J. Radford-Smith, pers. comm. 2020)."
Gossia bamagensis (Myrteae),Y,3.9 (7),−15.2° to −10.7°,Data deficient,"Occurs largely in gallery forest and dry, seasonal rainforest throughout far north Queensland. Moderate impacts from myrtle rust have been recorded. Seedlings occasionally observed in the wild."
Rhodamnia sessiliflora (Myrteae),Y,3.7 (48),−19.2° to −15.7°,Low,"A tree favouring canopy gaps in rainforest and secondary forest (S. McKenna, pers. comm. 2020). Myrtle rust impacts are variable, ranging from minor to severe stem dieback and reduced reproductive capacity. Seedlings occasionally observed in the wild."
Eugenia reinwardtiana (Myrteae),Y,3.7 (27),−25.4° to −10.5°,Moderate,"A highly variable species, often locally abundant with each form differing in its susceptibility to myrtle rust. Impacts range from low to severe stem dieback. Seedlings occasionally observed in the wild. Nursery grown plants are impacted but some survive (S. Shaw, J. Halford, pers. comm. 2020)."
Mitrantia bilocularis (Kanieae),Y,3.5 (3),−16.3°,Data deficient,"A rare and highly restricted species, known only from one site in Daintree National Park. While a dominant species at this site, few seedlings were observed and all exhibit damage from myrtle rust."
Rhodomyrtus effusa (Myrteae),Y,3.5 (12),−16.5° to −15.8°,Moderate,"Exhibits variation in its susceptibility to myrtle rust infection, with impacts ranging from low to severe stem dieback. Favours disturbed or regrowth rainforest communities (Zich et al., 2020). Seedlings occasionally observed in the wild."
Gossia grayi (Myrteae),Y,3.5 (11),−18.2° to −12.9°,Data deficient,"An uncommon shrub or small tree, favouring well-developed montane rainforest. Plants exhibit moderate stem dieback from myrtle rust infection, with seedlings also affected although rarely observed in the wild."
Rhodamnia argentea (Myrteae),Y,3.4 (30),−32.2° to −20.8°,Moderate,"An uncommon species in small to large tree of subtropical and dry rainforest, with myrtle rust impacts ranging from low to severe stem dieback. Seedlings occasionally observed in the wild."
Gossia acmenoides (Myrteae),Y,3.2 (27),−34.5° to −21.0°,Moderate,"A locally common shrub to medium-sized tree of dry and subtropical rainforest, with myrtle rust impacts ranging from low to severe stem dieback. Myrtle rust affected seedlings and reproductive material have been occasionally observed in the wild."
Rhodamnia whiteana (Myrteae),Y,3.2 (14),−28.5° to −27.8°,Moderate,"A small to medium-sized tree, restricted to cool subtropical rainforest over 700 m altitude. Myrtle rust damage ranges from low to moderate stem dieback, with seedlings also affected, although only occasionally observed in the wild."
