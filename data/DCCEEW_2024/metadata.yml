  description: Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act status for
    Australian plant species.

    for a description of the process of listing species as threatened. Australia is
    home to between 600,000 and 700,000 species, many of which are found nowhere else
    in the world. About 84 per cent of plants, 83 per cent of mammals, and 45 per
    cent of birds are only found in Australia. Changes to the landscape and native
    habitat as a result of human activity have put many of these unique species at
    risk. Over the last two hundred years many species of plants and animals have
    become extinct. For the other species of plants and animals whose survival is
    threatened, a range of management and conservation measures are in place. Ecological
    communities are unique and naturally occurring groups of plants and animals. Their
    presence can be determined by factors such as soil type, position in the landscape,
    climate and water availability. The Australian Government is working in partnership
    with state, territory and local governments, non-government organisations, tertiary
    institutions and community groups to ensure the protection of our native species.
