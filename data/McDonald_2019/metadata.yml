  description: This study compared ground cover, plant species composition and floristic
    and functional diversity along gradients of grazing intensity between a pastoral
    property rotationally grazed by goats and an adjacent nature reserve (ungrazed
    by commercial livestock) in semi-arid south-eastern Australia to understand if
    alternative grazing management practices, such as rotational grazing, may be a
    viable option for broad-scale biodiversity conservation and sustainable pastoral
    management.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Study area ^p This study was undertaken in mulga (Acacia aneura)
    woodland in the Mulga Lands bioregion of north-western New South Wales (NSW),
    Australia (29o51'S, 143o53'E, ~150 m a.s.l.; Appendix S1 Fig. S1). The climate
    is semi-arid, with a mean annual precipitation of 282 mm recorded at Wanaaring
    (Bureau of Meteorology 2017). More rainfall is recorded in the summer months on
    average, but rainfall is generally unpredictable and sporadic throughout the year.
    Only 186 mm of rain was recorded in the 12 months prior to sampling, and conditions
    were dry at the time of sampling. Mean maximum temperatures are 36.9°C in January
    and 18.2°C in July, and mean minimum temperatures are 22.0°C in January and 4.3°C
    in July at Wanaaring (Bureau of Meteorology 2017). Soils are deep sandy to sandy
    loam red earths, with relief to 5 m (Walker 1991). Mulga is the dominant tree
    or tall shrub throughout the landscape, arranged in distinct groves and becoming
    denser along drainage lines. In addition, scattered ironwood (Acacia excelsa),
    bimble box (Eucalyptus populnea subsp. bimbil), beefwood (Grevillea striata) and
    whitewood (Atalaya hemiglauca) are present, and areas of woody shrubs (Eremophila
    spp., Dodonaea viscosa, Senna spp.) are common. Woollybutt (Eragrostis eriopoda)
    is the dominant understorey perennial grass. ^p Grazing management ^p The grazed
    property and nature reserve were surveyed in Autumn 2016 (Table 1). Both areas
    had historically been continuously grazed by sheep and cattle as per regional
    practice from the mid-1800s, with minimal fencing and water point development
    initially (see Appendix S1 for further information on grazing history). The grazed
    property was rotationally grazed by sheep from 2004 and predominantly by goats
    and some sheep and cattle since 2006. The highly variable stocking rates were
    regularly adjusted to match pasture availability and to prevent degradation of
    pasture and soils. Paddocks were rested for at least 6 months each year, with
    grazing periods ranging from 3 weeks to 4 months, depending on seasonal conditions.
    Water points were fenced off when livestock were not in paddocks to reduce grazing
    pressure from other herbivores. The nature reserve was established in 1979 when
    commercial livestock grazing was excluded, but native (macropods) and feral (goats,
    pigs, rabbits) herbivores were present in low numbers, with feral animals controlled
    as needed. The nature reserve was considered representative of current extensive,
    publicly funded conservation areas in Australia, where it is not logistically
    or economically possible or environmentally desirable to exclude all herbivores.
    Areas surveyed on the grazed property and nature reserve were comparable and experienced
    the same climate and consisted of the same soil (calcarosols, deep sandy to sandy
    loam red earths) and vegetation community (mulga woodland) described previously.
    ^p Study design ^p The design of this study was limited by the inability to find
    replicate properties with rotationally grazed paddocks and more than one protected
    area on the same land system. Previous studies have highlighted variation in biodiversity
    when large study areas have been utilised (Landsberg et al. 2003; McDonald et
    al. 2019). Hence, this study sampled plots within the same land system to ensure
    minimal landscape variation between the nature reserve and the spatially separated
    rotationally grazed paddocks on the adjacent commercial livestock property. Distance
    from water was used as an index of grazing intensity. Four paddocks (2079-3351
    ha in size) were sampled on the rotationally grazed property, and a comparable
    geographical spread of sites was sampled on the adjacent reserve, which lacked
    paddocks and water points (Table 1). ^p Across the four paddocks and the nature
    reserve, 70 points were randomly generated, with a minimum distance of 400 m between
    each point to achieve sample independence. Points were restricted to within 1000
    m of fence lines and tracks on the rotationally grazed property, and within 2000
    m of fence lines on the reserve, to allow timely completion of surveys and more
    time to survey plots, as it was not possible to drive to points. All points were
    ground-truthed, to ensure they were located on red sandy loam soils in mulga woodland.
    Areas of rocky hills or drainage lines were avoided as they were not represented
    on both the grazed property and the nature reserve, and plots were located at
    least 50 m from fence lines and tracks. Of the 70 points, 51 met these criteria
    and were sampled. At each point, a 20 x 20-m plot was established and nine 1 x
    1-m quadrats were located systematically within each plot, with a 2 m buffer from
    the plot edge, and 6.5 m between adjacent quadrats. Each plot and quadrat was
    surveyed once during April-May 2016. The proportion of ground cover consisting
    of live plant material, litter (dead herbaceous material), cryptogam, coarse woody
    debris (>2 cm diameter), dung, rock and bare ground was estimated in each quadrat.
    In addition, the number of both fresh and old pellets of goat/sheep (these could
    not be differentiated), macropod and rabbit dung, and the number of cattle pats,
    were counted in each quadrat to provide a measure of recent grazing intensity
    (Appendix S1 Table S1). ^p  Vegetation surveys ^p All understorey plant species
    (<3 m tall at maturity) were identified in each plot (400 m2). The per cent cover
    of each understorey plant species was estimated in each quadrat (1 m2). Understorey
    species richness in each plot and quadrat was calculated. Shannon-Wiener (SW)
    diversity and Pielou's evenness index were calculated for each plot using understorey
    species frequency data from quadrats. Understorey species pattern diversity (turnover)
    for each plot was calculated using the log of the slope of the understorey species
    accumulation curve generated from the quadrats in each plot. Overstorey woody
    plant species (>3 m) in each plot were identified, and the numbers of each species
    ≤0.5 m in height (seedlings) and >0.5 m in height (large) were counted. Density
    of seedling and large overstorey woody species, species richness and SW diversity
    of overstorey woody species were calculated for each plot.
