  description: Test of whether increased inoculum concentrations of myrtle rust in
    natural ecosystems may be contributing to observed changes in susceptibility phenotypes.
  basis_of_record: unknown
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: A study was undertaken to determine the effect of A. psidii inoculum
    concentration on myrtle rust disease incidence and severity on five native and
    one exotic species of Myrtaceae, under controlled conditions. These species have
    a range of naturally observed susceptibilities, Rhodamnia rubescens (high to extreme
    susceptibility), Syzygium hemilamprum (syn. Acmena hemilampra; relatively tolerant),
    S. leuhmanii (syn. A. leuhmanii; moderate susceptibility), S. moorei (relatively
    tolerant) and S. oleosum (high susceptibility) (Table 1). The extremely susceptible
    exotic species, Syzygium jambos, was used as a positive control. Plants were inoculated
    with either a control inoculation of 0.05% Tween in deionised water solution,
    or with a solution of A. psidii urediniospores at a low (1-2 x 10^2), moderate (1-2 x 10^4) or high (1-2 x 10^6) inoculum concentration (urediniospores ml-1
    in 0.05% Tween in deionised water). Inoculation methods followed those described
    by Pegg et al. (2014a), and plants were placed in a controlled environment room
    with a 12-h/26 °C light and 12- h/20 °C dark photoperiod with relative humidity
    set to 75%. Plants were assessed two weeks after inoculation for measures of disease
    incidence and severity, using methods modified from Ireland et al. 2012, 2019.
    For the leaf with the most severe infection per plant replicate (sensu Morin et
    al. 2012), disease incidence was recorded as presence or absence of uredinia per
    leaf, and disease severity was recorded as the percentage surface area of the
    leaf covered with uredinia.
