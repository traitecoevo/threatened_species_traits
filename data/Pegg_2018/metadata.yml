  description: A study that examined the variability in susceptibility to A. psidii
    (myrtle rust) within populations of Melaleuca quinquenervia, M. leucadendra and
    M. viridiflora using in-vitro assessments of seedlings from provenances across
    the native range of the three species.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: seedlings
  sampling_strategy: Seed source ^p Bulk seed-lots of the three broad-leaved paperbark
    species were sourced from the Australian Seed Bank collection. Most of the tested
    seed-lots were collected prior to 2010 when A. psidii was first detected in Australia
    (Table 1, Fig. 1), so no selection pressure had been applied by the disease. For
    M. quinquenervia an additional seed-lot, Boggy Creek, New South Wales, was collected
    in 2012 from a study site where trees were assessed for rust impact over time
    and seed collected from trees rated as resistant (Pegg et al. 2012). The provenance
    bulk seed-lots contained at least five parent trees where possible, so that findings
    would be representative of the source population. There were however, exceptions
    and these were included to ensure a good representation from across the species
    native range. ^p Seedlings ^p Seeds were sown in 40-celled hyco trays with plastic
    inserts (70 ml) in the glasshouse using a potting medium consisting of 50% pine
    bark fines (0-10 mm), 25% pine bark peat, 25% coarse perlite, a mix of 12-14 month
    slow release Osmocote® (N 17.9 to P 0.8 to K 7.3) fertiliser at a rate of 4 kg/m3,
    gypsum (1 kg/m3), Micromax (1 kg/m3) and a granular wetting agent Hydroflo2 (1
    kg/m3). Plants were irrigated twice a day for 10 min using an overhead spray.
    Seedlings were thinned over time to a single plant per cell. Plants were fertilised
    2 weeks prior to inoculation to ensure new growth flush. Previous studies on species
    of Eucalyptus and Corymbia have identified that seedlings showing visible evidence
    of nutrient deficiency, including poor or slow growth and chlorosis, produce false
    resistant reactions when infected under controlled conditions (Pegg unpublished).
    ^p Trial design ^p The trial was established as a randomised incomplete block
    design with 8 replicates of a five-tree line plot from each provenance treatment
    in each replicate. Under this design, the number of treatments per block (a subset
    of the replicate, used to account for variation within the replicate) is less
    than the number of treatments being evaluated. This type of trial design increases
    precision of the analysis and reduces experimental error. Incomplete block design
    trials can be thought of as two-factor experiments (block and treatment) with
    unequal numbers and no interaction between the block and treatment factors. ^p
    Inoculation ^p Austropuccinia psidii urediniospores were collected from Syzygium
    jambos plants and sieved to remove extraneous matter before being placed onto
    an open petri dish in a desiccator. Spores remained in the desiccator for approximately
    7 days to ensure moisture levels were at a minimum before being transferred into
    vials and stored at -80 °C. Urediniospores were removed from -80 °C storage and
    allowed to warm to room temperature before being added to sterile distilled water
    (SDW). The surfactant Tween 20 was added at a rate of two drops per 100 mL SDW
    and the spore suspension stirred to reduce clumping. Spores were counted using
    a haemocytometer and the suspension adjusted to a concentration of 1 x 105 spores/mL.
    ^p Plants were inoculated using a fine mist spray (29 kPa pressure), generated
    by a compressor driven spray gun (Iwata Studio series 1/6 hp.; Gravity spray gun
    RG3). The upper and lower leaf surfaces of the seedlings were sprayed, ensuring
    all leaves were coated with a fine mist but run-off of the spore suspension was
    avoided. ^p Once inoculated, seedlings were placed onto a plastic-lined metal
    bench and covered with another plastic sheet creating a sealed system. Plants
    were then placed into a Controlled Environment Room (CER) set at 18 °C in the
    dark for 24 h. Hot tap water (60 °C) was applied to the lower plastic sheet immediately
    before plants were placed into the CER to ensure high humidity levels and leaf
    wetness was achieved rapidly. Twenty-four hours after inoculation the plastic
    coverings were removed, and plants grown on in a shade-house and hand watered
    as required.

  trait_name: myrtle_rust_susceptibility_numeric
  entity_type: population

  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: No. parent trees
  methods: Disease progression was monitored regularly for the presence of symptoms. Disease was assessed on the primary and secondary foliage (youngest two expanding pairs of leaves) to avoid the influence leaf age may have on disease severity levels. As the foliage ages, it becomes less susceptible to infection. The following disease assessment ranking system (Pegg et al. 2014) was modified from that developed by Junghans et al. (2003). The scaling system used is, 1 = no symptoms evident or presence of flecking (chlorotic/clear); 2 = presence of a Hypersensitive Reaction (HR) with fleck or necrosis; 3 = small pustules, <0.8 mm diameter, with one or two uredinia; 4 = medium-sized pustules, 0.8-1.6 mm diameter with about 12 uredinia; 5 = large pustules, >1.6 mm diameter, with 20 or more uredinia on leaves, petioles and/or shoots. Classes 1 and 2 are considered resistant to A. psidii, while classes 3 to 5 susceptible (Fig. 2). Seedlings rated as resistant (rating 1 and 2) were inoculated for a second time to ensure these were not escapes or due to a lack of new growth flush being present at the time of inoculation.
