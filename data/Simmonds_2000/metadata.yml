  sampling_strategy: This book is directed at Australian goat producers, veterinarians
    and educators so as to increase their awareness of the many potential poisonous
    weeds that they may encounter. The weeds are listed by both common and botanical
    names, their relative palatability is graded and the poisonous compounds that
    they contain are named, suggestions on control strategies are given and finally
    the health and production problems that may result from the ingestion of each
    weed are outlined. For further details about individual weeds, readers are referred
    to more detailed text book accounts.  Many of the weeds dealt with have been declared
    noxious* by state authorities and as a consequence are required to be controlled
    by landholders. Grazing with goats can be a useful part of an integrated weed
    control strategy but owners should familiarise  themselves with the potential
    toxicity risk associated with grazing some weeds. Toxic weeds are those that can
    cause any upset to the health and productivity of an animal. Toxic does not automatically
    imply lethal but some toxic plants can be lethal.
