  description: Xylem transport of nitrogen and phosphorus was examined in mature mycorrhizal
    plants of 41 species in 15 genera of Epacridaceae in native habitat in south-west
    Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Xylem sap was collected from roots of a range of south-west Australian
    epacrids growing in native habitats ranging from kwongan sandplain, dunal heath,
    swamp, Banksia wood-land, and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Smith) and
    karri (E. diversicolor F. Muell.) forests. For each species at least three adult
    plants were utilized for sap collection. In certain cases plants of the same species
    were sampled from two or more widely separated habitats. Sampling was conducted
    in autumn, winter and spring of 1993 or 1994 and all plants from which sap was
    collected showed well infected hair roots. Sap collection involved displacement
    of xylem (tracheal) fluid by mild vacuum from freshly excavated 10±20 cm segments
    of root using the apparatus and techniques described by Pate et al. (1994). In
    three cases roots were of insufficient diameter for sap collection so lower regions
    of the stem were sampled.
