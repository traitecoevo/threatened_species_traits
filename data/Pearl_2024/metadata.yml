  description: The first general overview of mycorrhizal functional groups associated
    with the flora of the Queensland Sunshine Coast heathlands.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This dataset of plant taxa used for this study was based on the
    Sunshine Coast heath species list of 366 species derived from 80 sites, and records
    from other data sources (Pearl et al.2022; Supplementary Table S1). This was compared
    with a species list of 470 species from a rainforest study over 109 sites in the
    same geographic area (Fig. 1), and from the same research group (Scanlan et al.2018).
    Neither of these datasets focussed on a complete orchid inventory. All sites were
    0.1 ha in size. For the Sunshine Coast heath and rainforest communities, each
    plant species was allocated a mycorrhizal functional group, using the FungalRoot
    database (Soudzilovskaia et al. 2020). Species were allocated as AM, EcM-AM, ErM,
    NM, N-AM (Table S1). Ten species with no clear allocation to one of those groups
    (e.g. Brachyloma spp., Macarthuria spp.) were allocated 'Other'.
