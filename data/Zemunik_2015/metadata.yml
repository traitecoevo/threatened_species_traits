  description: A study in Western Australia's phosphorus-impoverished soils that shows
    marked increase in the richness and diversity of plant nutrient-acquisition strategies
    with declining soil phosphorus availability during long-term ecosystem development.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study was conducted on the Jurien Bay dune chronosequence16,
    which harbours exceptional floral diversity and where soil development extends
    from the Early Pleistocene through to the present16. The region experiences a
    Mediterranean climate, with a pronounced winter wet season (June-August) and an
    extended seasonal summer drought. The six chronosequence stages spanned ~45 km
    north to south and ~15 km west to east, and were delineated using a randomized
    stratified design. Each stage contained ten plots (10 x 10 m), each of which contained
    seven randomly positioned 2 x 2 m subplots. All vascular plant species within
    the subplots were identified, individuals per species counted, and canopy cover
    estimated visually. Relative cover was subsequently calculated by normalizing
    the absolute cover against the total cover. Nutrient-acquisition strategies were
    initially assigned based on the literature and online resources11; species that
    had substantial relative cover within a plot (>4%), but whose strategies were
    unknown, were subsequently analysed for mycorrhizal colonization using root samples
    taken in the field during the rainy season. In total, 62 plant species (out of
    349 species in total), representing 27 families, were examined for their nutrient-acquisition
    strategies (Supplementary Table 3). Seven soil samples per 10 x 10 m plot (that
    is one in the middle of each of the seven 2 x 2 m subplots) were taken from the
    top 20 cm and were analysed for a range of total and available nutrients, and
    properties. ^p Flora surveys. Surveys of all vascular plants in the plots were
    done in August, September,October and November of 2011, and January, February,
    March and September of 2012. Plots that were initially surveyed outside the peak-flowering
    season (approximately August to November) were resurveyed in September 2012 to
    ensure that seasonal (annual or geophytic) species would be observed. All vascular
    plants were recorded and identified in the field to the species (or subspecies)
    level when identification was certain. Field names were given and specimens taken
    for later reference for those for which identity was uncertain. The identity of
    undetermined species was resolved, whenever possible, at the Western Australian
    Herbarium. Species names and family associations followed the APG III classification.

  methods: Clearing and staining of root segments were done using KOH and trypan blue
    using an adjusted standard procedure40,41 . Specifically, after washing off all
    excess soil, roots were immersed in tubes containing either 2.5% or 10% (w/v)
    KOH, depending on root toughness and thickness. The tubes were then placed in
    a boiling water bath for up to 1 h, depending on the darkness of the roots. After
    removal from the KOH solution, if the roots were not sufficiently clear, they
    were rinsed and bleached in 10 vol (3%, v/v) H2 O2 for 10 min. All root segments
    were then rinsed thoroughly and returned to their tubes with 2% (v/v) HCl, and
    left to acidify for at least 1 h. The roots were then rinsed in tap water and
    stained with 0.05% (w/v) trypan blue in an acidified glycerol solution by heating
    in a boiling water bath for 10 min. After thoroughly rinsing the roots in tap
    water, excess staining was removed by immersing and storing the stained roots
    in acidified glycerol Colonisation was assessed using light microscopy (x200-400
    magnification) of slide-mounted sections of fine roots. For eight of the species,
    which had at least nine separate samples, colonisation was quantitatively assessed
    using the magnified intersects method 42; the other species had their mycorrhizal
    status qualitatively assessed, based on repeated presence of structures consistent
    with each specific type of mycorrhiza. For arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) these diagnostic
    features were arbuscules, Paris coils, or vesicles combined with morphology of
    hyphae consistent with AM. For ectomycorrhizas, the diagnostic features were the
    presence of both Hartig nets and mantle hyphae

  reason: Fuzzy match of taxon name to an APC-accepted canonical name once punctuation
    and filler words are removed (2025-05-11)
  taxonomic_resolution: subspecies
- find: Lepidosperma aff. squamatum
  replace: Lepidosperma sp. [Lepidosperma aff. squamatum; Zemunik_2015]
  reason: Exact match to APC genus. Taxon name includes 'affinis' or 'aff' indicating
    an unknown taxon that bears an affinity to a different taxon in the same genus
    and taxon can only be aligned to genus-rank (2025-05-11)
