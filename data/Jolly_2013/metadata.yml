  description: A review to thoroughly investigate the gaps in nutritional information
    to support future investment decisions by Meat & Livestock Australia to underpin
    the growth of the goat industry.
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The purpose of this review was to thoroughly investigate the
    gaps in nutritional information to support future investment decisions by Meat
    & Livestock Australia to underpin the growth of the goat industry. The terms of
    reference were as follows, 1) Clarify the nutritional requirements for goats;
    2) Determine how and why publications vary widely in their recommendations; 3)
    Determine the variation in nutrient requirements between rangeland, Boer, Boer-cross,
    dairy and fleece-producing goats and their progeny; 4) Investigate the alignment
    between the recommendations and animals response to a range of feeding regimes
    and practises This review has provided confirmation that the guidelines for the
    nutrient requirements of goats vary widely and that there remains a diversity
    of opinion as to which is the correct source of information. NRC (2007) has published
    the most comprehensive set of recommendations following an extensive review of
    published research from 1981 to 2006 however these guidelines require validation
    under a range of environmental conditions.
