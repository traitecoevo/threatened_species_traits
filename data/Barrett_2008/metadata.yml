  description: A risk-assessment tool was used to investigate the risk of extinction from disease caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi to 33 taxa from the Stirling Range National Park, Western Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Flora investigated Thirty-three plant taxa of conservation significance were assessed (Table 1). Threatened flora were ranked Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulnerable nationally under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) and in Western Australia (WA) by using IUCN criteria (IUCN 2001). Poorly known or Priority flora are data-deficient species (IUCN 2001) and are categorised in WA as Priority 1, 2, 3 or 4 (Atkins 1998, 2006). Twenty-three taxa are endemic tothe SRNP; another three taxa (Lambertia ericifolia R.Br., Kunzea montana (Diels) Domin andEucalyptus ligulata subsp.stirlingicaD.Nicolle) each have a single outlying population in close proximity to the park, and these were included in the study. Seven taxa have significant outlying populations disjunct from the park. These were Banksia browniiR.Br.,Daviesia obovataTurcz.,Banksia pseudoplumosa A.S. George, Adenanthos pungens Meisn. subsp. pungens, Sphenotoma drummondii (Benth.) F.Muell., Andersonia echinocephala (Stschegel.) Druce and Calothamnus affinis Turcz. These taxa were assessed in terms of their extinction risk within the park only. Plant nomenclature follows (Paczkowska and Chapman 2000; Mast and Thiele 2007).

  methods: The susceptibility score of each taxon was then calculated as follows, if t1/2K = 0, then susceptibility scoretaxon=0; if t1/2K > 0, then susceptibility scoretaxon=Kmax + (100-t1/2K) + (100xr).
