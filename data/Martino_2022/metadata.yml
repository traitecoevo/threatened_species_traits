  description: This study established that 3 previously unscreened species of Melaleuca, grown from seeds sourced from Western Australian populations, were susceptible to the pandemic strain of the pathogen Austropuccinia psidii present in eastern Australia.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: saplings
  sampling_strategy: To determine susceptibility of Melaleuca species from Western Australia in response to the pathogen, seed from Melaleuca thyoides and Melaleuca marginata was obtained from Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions King's Park seed bank. Although known to be susceptible (Pegg et al. 2018), seed from Melaleuca leucadendra was also obtained from a Western Australian population not previously assessed for susceptibility. For each species, seed was collected from multiple trees at 33°39'45"S 115°20'59"E, 29°07'21.9"S 115°05'46.8"E, and 16°47'10.0"S 124°55'14.5"E respectively (Fig. 1). ^p Seeds were sown into perforated trays containing a mix of 2:1:1 peat, coconut coir, and perlite supplemented with Osmocote® Native Controlled Release Fertiliser then covered with a fine coating of vermiculite. Perforated trays were placed into solid trays filled with and always maintaining 1 cm of water. Seeds were germinated under natural light in a climate-controlled glasshouse set at 26 °C/20°C daytime/night time temperature on a 12 h cycle. Germinated seedlings were transplanted into 85 mL pots (5 cm diameter and depth) containing a mix of 2:1:1 Osmocote® Native Premium Potting Mix, peat, and perlite supplemented with Osmocote® Native Controlled Release Fertiliser then placed in solid trays filled with and always maintaining 1 cm of water. Seedlings were grown under the same glasshouse conditions as for germination. ^p Inoculation of 57 M. thyoides, 26 M. marginata and 51 M. leucadendra was conducted three months post germination at the Plant Breeding Institute at the University of Sydney (Cobbitty, NSW) alongside a known highly susceptible host Syzygium jambos as a positive control. Approximately 50 mg of A. psidii urediniospores from a single isolate(Sandhu and Park 2013) was added to 50 mL of Isopar® for a final concentration of 1 mg spores/mL. Seedlings were inoculated with inoculum using an aerosol sprayer and relocated to a humid incubation chamber for 24 h at 20 °C. After incubation, seedlings were transferred to a glasshouse with the temperature set to 26 °C/20°C daytime/nighttime temperature on a 12 h cycle.
