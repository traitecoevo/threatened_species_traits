  description: A database of the susceptibility of Australia's native vegetation to
    Phytophthora cinnamomi, including data for 1773 species.
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  measurement_remarks: measurement_remarks
  sampling_strategy: The list of O'Gara et al. (2006) was checked and updated with
    recent taxonomic changes and more recently published and unpublished data on species
    responses were added. These data included records from the Western Australian
    Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions Vegetation Health Services
    Phytophthora database (accessed 14 January 2022), which has over 20,000 records
    of isolations from plants and soil in Western Australia, dating from 1982. These
    records are primarily derived from single baiting of soil and plant root material
    for the presence or absence of Phytophthora pathogens, but some samples may have
    been double-baited or sent to the Centre for Phytophthora Science and Management
    (Murdoch University) for DNA sequencing; approximately 85% of isolations in the
    database are for P. cinnamomi. Data for glasshouse inoculation trials on more
    than 400, mostly Western Australian, native plant species were utilised (C. E.
    Crane and B. L. Shearer, unpubl. data). Pots containing test species were inoculated
    with P. cinnamomi as described by Shearer et al. (2007). The species tested included
    170 threatened and 217 priority flora from the WA ex situ conservation program,
    which were provided for research on Phytophthora susceptibility. The full list
    of data sources is in Supplementary material S1. We aimed to gather all available
    data but do not include all data sources where a subsequent review included preceding
    data (e.g. Weste 2001). In addition, data from a few sources cited in O'Gara et
    al. (2006), which could not be checked, were omitted from the list.
  original_file: SI for publication, which includes a full reference list.
  notes: There are 218 species in excluded data - these are taxa for which P. cinnamomi
    has been isolated from plant tissues but for which the response was not recorded.

  methods: We used ALA spatial data (accessed between 14 October 2022 and 13 March 2023) and ALA data tools to calculate the extent of occurrence (EOO) and climatic suitability for P. cinnamomi. Disjunct records were first checked in local floras and removed if not supported for their distribution; these were typically records of cultivated plants in capital city botanic gardens or data-entry errors. Accepted point locations for a species were screened for climatic habitat suitability for P. cinnamomi by using the Scatterplot tool; a species was deemed to occur in suitable habitat if >25% of records had an annual rainfall of >400 mm and a mean annual temperature of >10Â°C (climatic conditions considered to be thresholds for P. cinnamomi activity; O'Gara et al. 2006). For species in the updated list of O'Gara et al. (2006), we recorded conservation status (Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered) under the EPBC Act (http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicthreatenedlist.pl?wanted=flora, accessed 5 May 2023). For species not listed under the EPBC Act, EOO (as an alpha hull) was calculated using the Calculate AOO and EOO tool in the ALA. Species were identified that could be regarded as threatened under IUCN criteria if other criteria relating to threat or population decline were met (IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee 2022), as follows, Vulnerable (alpha hull between 5000 and 20,000 km2), Endangered (alpha hull between 500 and 5000 km2) or Critically Endangered (alpha hull <500 km2) or as Not Threatened (alpha hull >20,000 km2). Given potential inflation of EOO because of spatial errors of species occurrence data in ALA, we included species as Vulnerable if their EOO was greater than 20,000 km2 and less than 50,000 km2, and all occurrences were in suitable habitat for P. cinnamomi.
