  methods: Phytophthora dieback infestations in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve were
    mapped by Hart (1983), 1987-1989 (Brittain 1989) and in 1994-1995 (M. Grant, unpubl.
    data) by the interpretation of patterns of plant death and by the isolation of
    the pathogen from roots of dead and dying susceptible species (Department of Parks
    and Wildlife 2015). A large area south and west of Kaiupgidukgidj (Nooongar name
    for Moates Lake Knapp et al. 2024)/Moates Lake (Fig. 1) was not assessed as much
    of this area is a sand dune. In January 2024, areas north of Maardjitup Gurlin/Mt
    Gardner mapped as dieback-free or non-interpretable and areas mapped as infested
    in the Isthmus were re-assessed (Fig. 1).
