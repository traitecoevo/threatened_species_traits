  description: This study investigated the influence of P. cinnamomi infestation on the structure, taxonomic and functional diversity, and species composition of the forest.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: 2.1 Study area and design ^p The study areas were Eucalyptus marginata forest reserves in the Mundaring Shire 35 km east of Perth, Western Australia. The soil in the area features coarse-textured laterites, which provide favourable conditions for P. cinnamomi because of their ability to hold water infiltrating from winter rains (Shearer & Tippett, 1989). The climate is a typical mediterranean type featuring hot, dry summers followed by cold, wet winters (Bradshaw, 2015). The mean annual rainfall is 1063.5 mm, with most falling between winter and spring. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures are 22.6°C and 11.3°C respectively (Australian Bureau of Meteorology, 2023). ^p On each of the five reserves (Alps Street, Black Cockatoo, Falls Road, Quail Street and Super Block), four or five transects were set up at right angles across the dieback front (Table 1). A 45 m transect was marked from the active disease edge in both infested and non-infested zones. The first 15 m of the transect in both directions was excluded as it was considered a transitional area. Therefore, the data were collected along 30 m long transects from both infested and non-infested zones. The 30 m transect was further divided into four equal sections (7.5 m) to improve the statistical power of the analyses. The positioning of each transect was assisted by an accredited Phytophthora dieback interpreter, and informed by existing Phytophthora dieback infestation mapping, which had included targeted sampling of soil and plant tissues for Phytophthora (Terratree Pty Ltd, 2020) (Appendix S1). The dieback occurrence maps of each reserve are provided in the Supporting Information. ^p 2.2 Taxonomic and structural data and calculation of taxonomic diversity ^p In 2020, during the peak flowering period for jarrah forest species (October and November), the abundance and cover (as cm long) of each species not taller than 2 m height occurring in the understorey was recorded along four 7.5 m sections of each 30 m transect. The projected percentage cover of the canopy trees at each 7.5 m section along the transect was averaged from four readings using a spherical densitometer oriented North, South, East, and West. These observations were collated into three matrices. For the first matrix, the counts of each understorey species were aggregated (Abundance data). For the second matrix, the cover of each understorey species (Understorey Cover data) was aggregated. For the third matrix, the tree canopy cover was aggregated (Tree Canopy data). Species nomenclature followed the Western Australian Herbarium (Western Australian Herbarium, 1998) and 93% of the 137 plant taxa (85 genera and 35 families) were identified as species level. All the recorded species were native to Western Australia except two weeds recorded in both infested and non-infested zones. ^p Four measures were selected to index taxonomic diversity (TD), firstly, species abundance, the total number of individuals recorded in each 7.5 m transect section, and secondly, species richness (alpha; Whittaker, 1960), the number of unique individuals recorded in each transect section. Species abundance and alpha were derived from the Abundance data using base R coding (R Core Team, 2023). Thirdly, Shannon diversity (which considers the abundance and relative frequency distribution of species in each transect section (H''; Magurran, 1988) and fourthly, Pielou evenness, which considers Shannon diversity, and maximum possible diversity value (EV; Pielou, 1966) were estimated. The values for H' and EV were calculated using the Abundance data combined with the 'diversity' function from the vegan R package (Oksanen et al., 2022). ^p 2.3 Trait data and calculation of functional diversity ^p Plant functional trait data (Trait data) were collected for ten categorical and three qualitative traits, grouped according to nutrient acquisition, carbon acquisition, disturbance tolerance and reproduction (Table 2). Traits were selected based on three criteria. Firstly, they should be related to plant responses to resource availability and environmental constraints (i.e., low nutrients and water availability, and carbon storage). Next, they should reflect a species' capacity to colonize new areas and to re-establish following disturbance (i.e., regular low-intensity fires). Lastly, they should be easy to measure in the field or derive from herbarium specimens (Western Australian Herbarium, 1998). Full details of the sources used are given in Appendix S2.
