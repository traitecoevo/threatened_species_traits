 Actinodium cunninghamii, commonly known as swamp daisy or Albany daisy,[3] is the only formally described species in the genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae, Actinodium and is endemic to Western Australia.
 Description Actinodium cunninghamii is a small, compact shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 30 cm (12 in) with leaves about 4 mm (0.16 in) long and 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) wide. The flowers are borne in pinkish-brown, daisy-like heads 20–30 mm (0.79–1.18 in) in diameter. The heads are made up of tiny, bell-shaped flowers surrounded by sterile, strap-like ray flowers.[4][5] A related, but as yet undescribed species presently given the name Actinodium sp. 'Fitzgerald River' and also commonly known as Albany daisy, is a sparsely-branched shrub up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) high with leaves 5–6 mm (0.20–0.24 in) long, the heads pink and white and 40–50 mm (1.6–2.0 in) wide. This species is more common than A. cunninghamii.[4][6] Taxonomy The genus Actinodium was first formally described in 1836 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in the journal Linnaea, Ein Journal für die Botanik in ihrem ganzen Umfange[7][8] and Schauer later described Actinodium cunninghamii in John Lindley's A Natural System of Botany from specimens collected by Allan Cunningham.[9][10] The genus name is derived from Greek and means ""like the spokes of a wheel"".[6][11] Distribution and habitat Actinodium cunninghamii grows in moist, sandy soil in forest and kwongan and is uncommon in nature. Both species of Actinodium usually grow in winter-wet depressions in near-coastal areas near Albany in the south-west of Western Australia.[4][5][12] Use in horticulture Actinodium sp. 'Fitzgerald River' (sometimes as A. cunninghamii) has been grown in gardens but is a short-lived plant requiring good drainage and a sheltered position. It can be propagated from cuttings.[6][13] Cultural references An image of A. cunninghamii was engraved for an Australian Stamp in 1985.[3] References","Actinodium cunninghamii is a small, compact shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 30 cm (12 in) with leaves about 4 mm (0.16 in) long and 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) wide.

 Agonis baxteri is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It is an erect, sometimes bushy shrub with elliptic to egg-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, and usually white flowers with 23 to 32 stamens.
 Description Agonis baxteri is an upright, often spindly shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in), its branchlets usually glabrous. Its leaves are dark green, elliptic to egg-shaped or narrowly so, with the narrower end towards the base, mostly 25–55 mm (0.98–2.17 in) long and 7–20 mm (0.28–0.79 in) wide, usually with three longitudinal veins. The flowers are arranged in clusters 15–25 mm (0.59–0.98 in) in diameter with hairy, grey, more or less round bracts 2.5–3.5 mm (0.098–0.138 in) long and similar bracteoles. The flowers are usually white, 12–14 mm (0.47–0.55 in) in diameter with sepals 1.8–2.5 mm (0.071–0.098 in) long, the petals 5–9 mm (0.20–0.35 in) long, and usually 23 to 32 stamens mostly 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long. Flowering mainly occurs from October to December and the fruits are in clusters 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) wide. The species is superficially similar to Taxandria marginata.[2][3][4] Taxonomy In 1867, George Bentham described Melaleuca baxteri in Flora Australiensis from specimens collected by William Baxter at ""King George's Sound or to the eastward"".[5][6] In 2007, Judy Wheeler and Neville Marchant changed the name to Agonis baxteri in the journal Nuytsia.[2][7] The specific epithet (baxteri) honours the collector of the type specimens.[8] Distribution and habitat Agonis baxteri is found on sandplains, dunes, swamps, stony hills, disturbed and disturbed areas along the south coast in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia in the Esperance Plains and Mallee IBRA bioregions where it grows in sand and loam over quartzite, limestone or granite.[4] Conservation status This species is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.[4] References","Agonis baxteri is an upright, often spindly shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in), its branchlets usually glabrous.

 Agonis flexuosa, commonly known as peppermint,[2] is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia.  The Noongar peoples know the tree as wanil, wonnow, wonong[3] or wannang.[4] It is a tree or shrub with pendulous, very narrowly elliptic, narrowly elliptic or narrowly egg-shaped leaves, white flowers with 20 to 25 stamens opposite the sepals and broadly top-shaped to broadly cup-shaped capsules. 
 Description Agonis flexuosa is usually a tree that typically grows to a height of 10 m (33 ft), sometimes a wind-swept mallee or almost prostrate shrub. Its branchlets are often twisted or zig-zagged, and usually glabrous as they age. The leaves are very narrowly elliptic, narrowly elliptic or narrowly egg-shaped, 80–135 mm (3.1–5.3 in) long and 3.5–12 mm (0.14–0.47 in) wide and sessile or on a petiole up to 5 mm (0.20 in) long. The leaves sometimes have soft, silky hairs when young, but become glabrous as they age, and have a prominent mid-vein and usually two other veins. The flowers are arranged in clusters 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) wide with broadly egg-shaped bracts and elliptic bracteoles 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long. The floral tube is 1.5–2 mm (0.059–0.079 in) long and the sepals are 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long with silky, greyish hairs. The petals are white, spatula-shaped, 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) long and there are 20 to 25 stamens with 3 to 5, sometimes up to 7 opposite the sepals, but none opposite the petals. The filaments are 1–1.5 mm (0.039–0.059 in) long and the style 1–2.5 mm (0.039–0.098 in) long. Flowering occurs from July to December, and the capsule is broadly top-shaped to broadly cup-shaped, 2.5–4 mm (0.098–0.157 in) long, in clusters 6–10 mm (0.24–0.39 in) wide.[2][5][6] Taxonomy This species was first formally described in 1809 by Carl Ludwig Willdenow who gave it the name Metrosideros flexuosa in his Enumeratio Plantarum Horti Regii Botanici Berolinensis.[7][8] In 1830, Robert Sweet transferred the species to Agonis in his Hortus Britannicus.[9][10] The genus name Agonis comes from the Greek agon meaning 'a gathering' or 'collection', probably referring to the flower heads[11] and the specific epithet (flexuosa) is Latin for 'zig-zag', referring to the zig-zag branches.[12] In 1844, Johannes Conrad Schauer describes two varieties of A. flexuosa and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census:
 Distribution and habitat Agonis flexuosa var. flexuosa occurs in a range of habitats from coastal heath to woodland or forest and in a range of soils, in the Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren bioregions of south-western Western Australia,[5][16] and var. latifolia mainly grows in sandy soil in heath, shrubland or woodland between Walpole and Cheyne Beach in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Warren bioregions, with a record from the Stirling Range.[5][17] Uses Horticultural variants are probably derived from the widespread population, growing as shrubs or trees and perhaps being flowerless. Some commercially produced cultivars include Agonis ‘Belbra Gold’ and Agonis ‘Fairy Foliage’.[5] The Noongar peoples used the plant leaves as an antiseptic; sapling trunks were used as spear shafts and digging sticks.[4] References","Agonis flexuosa is usually a tree that typically grows to a height of 10 m (33 ft), sometimes a wind-swept mallee or almost prostrate shrub.

 Allosyncarpia ternata, commonly known as an-binik, is a species of rainforest trees constituting part of the botanical family Myrtaceae and included in the eucalypts group. The only species in its genus, it was described in 1981 by Stanley Blake of the Queensland Herbarium. They grow naturally into large, spreading, shady trees, and are endemic to the Northern Territory of Australia. They grow in sandstone gorges along creeks emerging from the Arnhem Land plateau.[1][2] The common name anbinik comes from the Kundedjnjenghmi and Kundjeyhmi dialects of Bininj Kunwok, spoken in West Arnhem Land. In other dialects, such as the Kunwinjku spoken in Gunbalanya, the tree is known as manbinik.[3] Distribution and habitat The tree dominates the closed monsoon rainforest communities along the sandstone escarpment of the western Arnhem Land Plateau.  The distribution of the species appears to be limited to areas not subject to wildfire.[4][5][6][7][8][9] Ecology Allosyncarpia dominated rainforest is an important vegetation community along the floristic boundary between the patches of monsoon forest that are sheltered from wildfire, and the fire-tolerant, eucalypt dominated, tropical savannas.[4][5][6][7][8][2]
A species of sandstone favouring monitor, the long-tailed Varanus glebopalma, is closely associated with Allosyncarpia woodland in some parts of its range.[10] References  This Myrtaceae article is a stub.

 Angophora bakeri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved apple,[2] is a species of tree that is endemic to New South Wales. It has rough, fibrous bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white or creamy white flowers and oval to cylindrical fruit.
 Description Angophora bakeri is a tree that typically grows to a height of 10–18 m (33–59 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous grey bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have linear to narrow lance-shaped leaves that are more or less sessile, 50–100 mm (2.0–3.9 in) long, 4–10 mm (0.16–0.39 in) wide and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are thin, glossy green, paler on the lower surface, linear to narrow lance-shaped, 60–130 mm (2.4–5.1 in) long, 5–10 mm (0.2–0.4 in) wide on a petiole 3–10 mm (0.1–0.4 in) long, and arranged in opposite pairs. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets in groups of three or seven on a peduncle 7–18 mm (0.3–0.7 in) long, the individual buds on pedicels 4–11 mm (0.2–0.4 in) long. Mature buds are 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) long and 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) wide. There are five sepals up to 1 mm (0.04 in) long and the petals are about 3 mm (0.1 in) long and wide. Flowering occurs from December to February and the flowers are white or creamy white. The fruit is an oval to cylindrical, pale brown or grey capsule 8–10 mm (0.3–0.4 in) long and wide with ribbed sides.[2][3][4] Taxonomy and naming Angophora bakeri was first formally described in 1913 by Edwin Cuthbert Hall in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales.[5][6] The specific epithet honours Richard Thomas Baker.[4] In 1986, G.J.Leach described two subspecies in the journalTelopea and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census:[7] Distribution and habitat Narrow-leaved apple grows in sandy soil over sandstone and is widespread and locally abundant from Port Stephens to Nowra and as far west as Katoomba. There is also a disjunct population, previously known as Angophora exul, now a synonym of A. bakeri subsp. bakeri in the Gibraltar Range National Park.[2][4][3] Gallery References","Angophora bakeri is a tree that typically grows to a height of 10–18 m (33–59 ft) and forms a lignotuber.

 Metrosideros costata Gaertn.
 Angophora costata, commonly known as Sydney red gum, rusty gum or smooth-barked apple, is a species of tree that is endemic to eastern Australia. Reaching 30 m (100 ft)  in height, the species has distinctive smooth bark that is pinkish or orange-brown when new and fades to grey with age. Its lance-shaped leaves are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems, with white or creamy white flowers appearing from October to December. The flower buds are usually arranged in groups of three,  followed by ribbed, oval or bell-shaped fruit.
 Description Angophora costata is a tree that typically grows to a height of 30 m (100 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth pinkish or orange-brown bark that weathers to grey and is shed in small scales. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile, elliptical to egg-shaped leaves arranged in opposite pairs with a stem-clasping base, 60–125 mm (2.5–5 in) long and 20–65 mm (0.8–2.6 in) wide. Adult leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, glossy green but paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped or curved, 70–190 mm (2.8–7.5 in) long and 12–35 mm (0.5–1.4 in) wide on a petiole 9–25 mm (0.4–1.0 in) long. New leaf growth is strongly tinted with red. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle 3–25 mm (0.1–1.0 in) long, each branch of the peduncle with usually three buds on pedicels 3–15 mm (0.1–0.6 in) long. Mature buds are oval to globe-shaped, up to 10 mm (0.4 in) long and 11 mm (0.4 in) wide. There are five sepals up to 3 mm (0.1 in) long and the petals are white to creamy white with a green keel, 3–5 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long and 3–6 mm (0.1–0.2 in) wide. Flowering occurs from October to December. The fruit is an oval or bell-shaped capsule up to 20 mm (0.8 in) long and wide.[3][4][5] New seedlings have petiolate round cotyledon leaves 1.5 cm wide and long.[6] Taxonomy and naming Sydney red gum was first formally described in 1788 by German botanist Joseph Gaertner and given the name Metrosideros costata in his book De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum,[7] from material collected by surveyor David Burton around Port Jackson.[8] The specific epithet (costata) is a Latin word meaning 'ribbed'.[9] English botanist Richard Anthony Salisbury named it Metrisoderos apocynifolia in his 1796 work Prodromus stirpium in horto ad Chapel Allerton vigentium.[10]  Spanish taxonomist Antonio José Cavanilles erected the new genus Angophora in 1797 in his book Icones et Descriptiones Plantarum, giving the species the name Angophora lanceolata.[11] English botanist George Bentham used this last name in his Flora Australiensis in 1867.[12] English botanist James Britten changed the name to Angophora costata in the Journal of Botany, British and Foreign in 1916.[13][14] In 1986, Gregory John Leach described three subspecies in the journal Telopea and two names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census:[15] A third subspecies, subsp. leiocarpa was reclassified as a separate species Angophora leiocarpa.[19] A phylogenetic analysis of the genus published in 2021 confirmed its genetic distinctness from the two costata subspecies.[18] Recent genetic work has been published showing Angophora to be more closely related to Eucalyptus than Corymbia, and the name Eucalyptus apocynifolia has been proposed for this species if it were to be placed in the genus Eucalyptus.[20] This has not been taken up by the botanical community.[6] Common names include Sydney red gum, rusty gum, smooth-barked apple,[3] and smooth-barked angophora.[6] Aboriginal people from the Sydney region knew the tree as kajimbourra.[21] Distribution and habitat Angophora costata grows in sandy soil, often over sandstone and occurs naturally in Queensland and New South Wales. It is widely distributed in south-eastern Queensland and disjunctly in the White Mountains National Park. In New South Wales it mainly occurs in coastal areas south from Coffs Harbour to Narooma and as far west as the Blue Mountains.[3][4][5]
It is found from sea level to an altitude of 300 m (1,000 ft) in areas of predominantly summer rainfall receiving 600 to 1,200 mm (25 to 45 in) a year. Maximum temperatures across its range vary from 25 to 35 °C (77 to 95 °F) and minimum temperatures from 0 to 8 °C (32 to 46 °F), with anywhere from 0 to 50 days of frost.[6] In Victoria it is a commonly planted ornamental and is naturalised in some places.[5][22] It grows in open forest and woodland, in association with such species as Sydney peppermint (Eucalyptus piperita), bangalay (E. botryoides),[23] grey gum (E. punctata), blue-leaved stringybark (E. agglomerata), white mahogany (E. acmenoides), broad-leaved white mahogany (E. umbra), large-fruited red mahogany (E. scias),  red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), yellow bloodwood (C. eximia), pink bloodwood (C. intermedia) lemon-scented gum (C. citriodora),[6] turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), forest oak (Allocasuarina torulosa),[23] and cypress pines (Callitris species),[6] and in hind dune communities with wedding bush (Monotoca elliptica) and burrawang (Macrozamia communis).[23] Ecology Angophora costata trees can live over 100 years. The species responds to bushfire by resprouting from epicormic buds and its lignotuber; shoots on branches of older specimens arise after a month, while shoots resprout from the trunk and base of young plants within a month of a hot fire. Seedlings appear within 9 to 10 months.[23] The tree is parasitised by the long-flowered mistletoe (Dendrophthoe vitellina).[23] The flowers are eaten by the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) and little red flying fox (P. scapulatus), while the seed is eaten by the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans).[23] Although the bark of A. costata is smooth, many invertebrates are found there. Several spiders in the family Salticidae, including Servaea vestita, and pseudoscorpions live under loose bark. The flattened bug Stenocotis depressa evades detection by camouflage, and cockroaches and huntsman spiders live under the loose bark at the base of the trunk.[24] Angophora costata is also susceptible to the fungal pathogens Quambalaria pitotheka, Aulographina eucalypti and Cryptococcus neoformans.[25] Uses Smooth-barked apple grows well in a variety of situations and can be easily grown from seed in a loose, well-drained seed-raising mixture. Some specimens have a straight trunk while others have a more branching habit with twisted trunks. The tree sometimes sheds branches and should not be planted close to buildings.[26] The heartwood is hard though not durable. Pale pink-brown in colour, it has a density of 755–1045 kg/m3 and a coarse texture. It is not suitable for use on the ground,[6] though it has been used for fencing and rough flooring.[27] The pale sapwood has a width of up to 5 cm (2 in) and is susceptible to attack by borers of the genus Lyctus.[6] This tree produces abundant pollen but little nectar. and the honey produced is not highly regarded.[27] Significant individuals Angophora Reserve in the Sydney suburb of Avalon was named after a huge individual, reportedly around 300 years of age. That tree died in the late 20th century.[28] Also in Sydney, the upper Lane Cove River Valley has several large Sydney red gums, one near Conscript Pass was measured at 45 metres tall.[29] The largest known living tree in New Zealand (241 cm diameter) is located at Hobsonville near Auckland.[30] Gallery References","Angophora costata is a tree that typically grows to a height of 30 m (100 ft) and forms a lignotuber.

It is widely distributed in south-eastern Queensland and disjunctly in the White Mountains National Park. In New South Wales it mainly occurs in coastal areas south from Coffs Harbour to Narooma and as far west as the Blue Mountains.[3][4][5]
It is found from sea level to an altitude of 300 m (1,000 ft) in areas of predominantly summer rainfall receiving 600 to 1,200 mm (25 to 45 in) a year. Maximum temperatures across its range vary from 25 to 35 °C (77 to 95 °F) and minimum temperatures from 0 to 8 °C (32 to 46 °F), with anywhere from 0 to 50 days of frost.[6] In Victoria it is a commonly planted ornamental and is naturalised in some places.[5][22] It grows in open forest and woodland, in association with such species as Sydney peppermint (Eucalyptus piperita), bangalay (E. botryoides),[23] grey gum (E. punctata), blue-leaved stringybark (E. agglomerata), white mahogany (E. acmenoides), broad-leaved white mahogany (E. umbra), large-fruited red mahogany (E. scias),  red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), yellow bloodwood (C. eximia), pink bloodwood (C. intermedia) lemon-scented gum (C. citriodora),[6] turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), forest oak (Allocasuarina torulosa),[23] and cypress pines (Callitris species),[6] and in hind dune communities with wedding bush (Monotoca elliptica) and burrawang (Macrozamia communis).[23] Ecology Angophora costata trees can live over 100 years. The species responds to bushfire by resprouting from epicormic buds and its lignotuber; shoots on branches of older specimens arise after a month, while shoots resprout from the trunk and base of young plants within a month of a hot fire. Seedlings appear within 9 to 10 months.[23] The tree is parasitised by the long-flowered mistletoe (Dendrophthoe vitellina).[23] The flowers are eaten by the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) and little red flying fox (P. scapulatus), while the seed is eaten by the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans).[23] Although the bark of A. costata is smooth, many invertebrates are found there. Several spiders in the family Salticidae, including Servaea vestita, and pseudoscorpions live under loose bark. The flattened bug Stenocotis depressa evades detection by camouflage, and cockroaches and huntsman spiders live under the loose bark at the base of the trunk.[24] Angophora costata is also susceptible to the fungal pathogens Quambalaria pitotheka, Aulographina eucalypti and Cryptococcus neoformans.[25] Uses Smooth-barked apple grows well in a variety of situations and can be easily grown from seed in a loose, well-drained seed-raising mixture.

 Angophora floribunda, commonly known as the rough-barked apple,[2] is a common woodland and forest tree of the family Myrtaceae native to Eastern Australia. Reaching 30 m (100 ft) high, it is a large tree with fibrous bark and cream-white flowers that appear over the Austral summer. It grows on alluvial soils on floodplains and along watercourses. Much of the land it grew on has been cleared for agriculture.
 Description Angophora floribunda  is a large, wide, spreading tree growing to a height of 30 m (100 ft). The trunk is often gnarled and crooked with fibrous grey bark.[2] Like all members of the genus Angophora, the dull to glossy green leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem.  5.5 to 15 cm (2.2–6 in) long and 1–5 cm (0.4–2 in) wide. They are lanceolate to ovate and attached to the stems by  0.6–1.5 cm (0.2–0.6 in) long petioles. The leaves in the western parts of the range are narrower than those in more coastal regions.[3] The cream-white flowers appear from November to March.[4] It can be confused with A. subvelutina, but the latter has leaves that are heart-shaped at their base and lacking petioles, arise from the stem.[5] Taxonomy The rough-barked apple was described by James Edward Smith in 1797 as Metrosideros floribunda, having been collected by Surgeon-General of New South Wales, John White in 1794. It was growing from seed in Empress Josephine's arboretum at Malmaison by 1804, when Étienne Pierre Ventenat catalogued it in his  Jardin de la Malmaison.[6] The species name is derived from the Latin floribunda 'abundant flowers'.[7]Robert Sweet gave it its current name in 1830.[8] Common names include rough-barked apple, apple box, rusty gum, gum myrtle and Boondah.[8] Genetic work has been published showing Angophora to be more closely related to Eucalyptus than Corymbia, and in 2000 botanist Ian Brooker coined the name Eucalyptus florida  for this species as Eucalyptus floribunda and E. intermedia had already been used for other eucalypts.[9] This tree hybridises with the broad-leaved apple (Angophora subvelutina).[4] Genetic analysis suggests the two might be a single species, despite their different morphology. Hybridization is present in some populations where both taxa occur but not others.[10] The Charmhaven apple (Angophora inopina) from the vicinity of Wyee on the Central Coast of New South Wales is closely related and may be a dwarf form of A. floribunda.[3] Distribution and habitat The range is across eastern Australia, from Rolleston and Roma in central Queensland though eastern and central New South Wales and into eastern Victoria, where it is found at Mallacoota.[3] It is found on alluvial soils, generally on shale or basalt soils.[4] In open forest, it is associated with such trees as swamp she-oak (Casuarina glauca), white stringybark (Eucalyptus globoidea), blackbutt (E. pilularis), Blakelys red gum (E. blakelyi), forest red gum (E. tereticornis), brittle gum (E. mannifera), forest she-oak (Allocasuarina torulosa), grey gum (E. punctata), and broad-leaved white mahogany (E. umbra). In wetter forest, it grows alongside Sydney blue gum (E. saligna) and in closed forest alongside lillypilly (Syzygium smithii), cheese tree (Glochidion ferdinandi), Australian white birch (Schizomeria ovata) and sandpaper fig (Ficus coronata) and under emergent specimens of bangalay (E. botryoides), grey ironbark (E. paniculata) and turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera).[4] Ecology The rough-barked apple regenerates by regrowing from epicormic buds after bushfire. Trees live for more than a hundred years. The grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) and little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) eat the flowers, and the white-plumed honeyeater (Ptilotula penicillata) forages among the flowers.[4] The tree is used as a nesting site by the rare regent honeyeater  (Anthochaera phrygia).[4] The jewel beetle species Curis caloptera, Stigmodera andersoni, S. terminatis and S. vigilans also visit the flowers, the latter three species being fairly specific in their preference for Angophora floribunda.[11] The longhorn beetle species Paroplites australis and Agrianome spinicollis have been recorded from the rough-barked apple.[12] Angophora floribunda has been recorded as a host for several mistletoe species: Amyema bifurcata, A. miquelii, A. pendula, Dendrophthoe curvata, D. glabrescens, D. vitellina, Muellerina celastroides and M. eucalyptoides.[13] Female scarlet myzomelas (Myzomela sanguinolenta) have been observed tearing off bark to use in building their nests.[14] Cultivation This is a large plant generally unsuitable for any but the largest gardens.

 Eucalyptus hispida (Sm.) BrookerAngophora cordifolia Cav.
 Angophora hispida grows as a mallee, or as a tree to about 7 m (23 ft) in height.[2]
Its small size, especially when compared to its Angophora and Eucalyptus relatives, leads to it being known by the common name dwarf apple.[3] It is native to a relatively small patch of central New South Wales – from just south of Sydney up to the Gosford area. The plant's leaves are sessile (stalk-less) and hug the stem with heart-shaped bases. Its previous name – A. cordifolia – referred to these cordate leaves. Another distinctive feature is the red bristly hairs that cover the branchlets, flower bases and new growth. This leads to the specific epithet hispida (meaning 'bristly').
 Description Dwarf apple grows as a small tree or mallee to 7 m (23 ft) high. It has greyish flaky bark.[4] Like other members of the genus Angophora and unlike other eucalypts, the leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem.[5] Sitting on petiole 0–4 mm long, the leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, and measure 5–10 cm (2.0–3.9 in) in length and 3–4.5 cm (1.2–1.8 in) across, with a blunt rounded apex, and a cordate (heart-shaped) base.[4] They are pale yellow-green above and greyish on their undersurface.[5] New growth is covered in reddish hairs.[5] Flowering takes place from November to January.[6] The showy creamy-white flower heads are terminal and umbellate, each composed of three to seven flowers on 0.8–3.2 cm (0.31–1.26 in) long pedicels, which in turn branch off from a 1.5–7 cm (0.59–2.76 in) long peduncle. Like the new leaves and stems, developing buds are covered in reddish hair. Globular in shape with longitudinal ribbing, they grow to a diameter of 0.9–1.3 cm (0.35–0.51 in).[7] The flowers fall leaving the cup-shaped woody seed pods or fruit, which measure 1.5–2.6 cm (0.59–1.02 in) long and 1.3–2 cm (0.51–0.79 in) in diameter.[7] These shed the mature seed in February and March.[6] The oval-shaped seeds are brown and flat, measuring 0.8–1 cm (0.31–0.39 in) long.[7] Taxonomy Common names include dwarf apple and scrub apple,[6] and banda in the Cadigal language.[4] Loddiges Nursery called it the Rough Metrosideros[8] after the dwarf apple was described by James Edward Smith in 1797 as Metrosideros hispida, having been collected by Surgeon-General of New South Wales, John White in 1795.[8]Antonio José Cavanilles also described it the same year as Angophora cordifolia, having been collected somewhere near the shoreline in Port Jackson.[9] The latter name remained in use until 1976, when A. hispida was erected by Don Blaxell,[10]  who had established that Smith's name had been published four months earlier in May (contrasting with Cavanillles in September) of 1797.[11] Smith had been sent a specimen by Surgeon-General White, which flowered in 1798. He went on to publish a fuller description accompanied by an illustration by James Sowerby in 1805.[11] Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a phylogenetic study based on morphology and came up with the smudgy apple (Angophora woodsiana) as the dwarf apple's closest relative.[12] Brooker and colleagues consider it to be more closely related to the broad-leaved apple (A. subvelutina).[7] More recently, genetic work has been published showing Angophora to be more closely related to Eucalyptus than Corymbia, and the name Eucalyptus hispida has been proposed for this species if it were to be placed in the eucalypt genus.[13] Hybrids with Angophora costata and A. bakeri have been recorded.[6] Distribution and habitat Dwarf apple is found only in the Sydney Basin, as far south as O’Hares Creek off the Georges River, on dry sandstone soils low in nutrients. The associated plant communities are heath, scrubland or open woodland, with such species as scribbly gums (Eucalyptus racemosa and E. haemastoma), red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri), heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), rusty banksia (B. oblongifolia), silver banksia (B. marginata), conesticks (Petrophile pulchella), scrub sheoak (Allocasuarina distyla), wax flower (Eriostemon australasius) and parrot pea (Dillwynia floribunda).[6] It grows from sea level to an altitude of 300 m (980 ft) and with an annual rainfall of 800 to 1,600 mm (31 to 63 in).[6] Ecology Dwarf apple regenerates from bushfire by resprouting from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, or epicormic shoots. It can flower within a year of being burnt and plays an important role as a food source for nectar-eating insects after bushfire.[6] The flowers attract birds, such as the noisy miner and wattlebirds, and a wide variety of insects, including honeybees, native bees, flies, moths and butterflies, and a wide array of beetles, including the rose chafer (Eupoecila australasiae), green-velvet flower chafer (Glycyphana brunnipes), the variable jewel beetle (Temognatha variabilis), the cowboy beetle (Chondropyga dorsalis), and a scarab beetle Bisallardiana gymnopleura, as well as members of the scarab genus Phyllotocus and soldier beetle genus Telephorus.[6] The dwarf apple is a host for larvae of froghoppers, known as spittlebugs.[6] Angophora hispida has been recorded as a host for the mistletoe species Muellerina eucalyptoides.[14] Use in horticulture This is a small tree suitable for larger gardens, its red new growth and profuse white flowers are attractive horticultural features.

It has greyish flaky bark.[4] Like other members of the genus Angophora and unlike other eucalypts, the leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem.[5] Sitting on petiole 0–4 mm long, the leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, and measure 5–10 cm (2.0–3.9 in) in length and 3–4.5 cm (1.2–1.8 in) across, with a blunt rounded apex, and a cordate (heart-shaped) base.[4] They are pale yellow-green above and greyish on their undersurface.[5] New growth is covered in reddish hairs.[5] Flowering takes place from November to January.[6] The showy creamy-white flower heads are terminal and umbellate, each composed of three to seven flowers on 0.8–3.2 cm (0.31–1.26 in) long pedicels, which in turn branch off from a 1.5–7 cm (0.59–2.76 in) long peduncle. Like the new leaves and stems, developing buds are covered in reddish hair. Globular in shape with longitudinal ribbing, they grow to a diameter of 0.9–1.3 cm (0.35–0.51 in).[7] The flowers fall leaving the cup-shaped woody seed pods or fruit, which measure 1.5–2.6 cm (0.59–1.02 in) long and 1.3–2 cm (0.51–0.79 in) in diameter.[7] These shed the mature seed in February and March.[6] The oval-shaped seeds are brown and flat, measuring 0.8–1 cm (0.31–0.39 in) long.[7] Taxonomy Common names include dwarf apple and scrub apple,[6] and banda in the Cadigal language.[4] Loddiges Nursery called it the Rough Metrosideros[8] after the dwarf apple was described by James Edward Smith in 1797 as Metrosideros hispida, having been collected by Surgeon-General of New South Wales, John White in 1795.[8]Antonio José Cavanilles also described it the same year as Angophora cordifolia, having been collected somewhere near the shoreline in Port Jackson.[9] The latter name remained in use until 1976, when A. hispida was erected by Don Blaxell,[10]  who had established that Smith's name had been published four months earlier in May (contrasting with Cavanillles in September) of 1797.[11] Smith had been sent a specimen by Surgeon-General White, which flowered in 1798. He went on to publish a fuller description accompanied by an illustration by James Sowerby in 1805.[11] Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a phylogenetic study based on morphology and came up with the smudgy apple (Angophora woodsiana) as the dwarf apple's closest relative.[12] Brooker and colleagues consider it to be more closely related to the broad-leaved apple (A. subvelutina).[7] More recently, genetic work has been published showing Angophora to be more closely related to Eucalyptus than Corymbia, and the name Eucalyptus hispida has been proposed for this species if it were to be placed in the eucalypt genus.[13] Hybrids with Angophora costata and A. bakeri have been recorded.[6] Distribution and habitat Dwarf apple is found only in the Sydney Basin, as far south as O’Hares Creek off the Georges River, on dry sandstone soils low in nutrients. The associated plant communities are heath, scrubland or open woodland, with such species as scribbly gums (Eucalyptus racemosa and E. haemastoma), red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri), heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), rusty banksia (B. oblongifolia), silver banksia (B. marginata), conesticks (Petrophile pulchella), scrub sheoak (Allocasuarina distyla), wax flower (Eriostemon australasius) and parrot pea (Dillwynia floribunda).[6] It grows from sea level to an altitude of 300 m (980 ft) and with an annual rainfall of 800 to 1,600 mm (31 to 63 in).[6] Ecology Dwarf apple regenerates from bushfire by resprouting from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, or epicormic shoots. It can flower within a year of being burnt and plays an important role as a food source for nectar-eating insects after bushfire.[6] The flowers attract birds, such as the noisy miner and wattlebirds, and a wide variety of insects, including honeybees, native bees, flies, moths and butterflies, and a wide array of beetles, including the rose chafer (Eupoecila australasiae), green-velvet flower chafer (Glycyphana brunnipes), the variable jewel beetle (Temognatha variabilis), the cowboy beetle (Chondropyga dorsalis), and a scarab beetle Bisallardiana gymnopleura, as well as members of the scarab genus Phyllotocus and soldier beetle genus Telephorus.[6] The dwarf apple is a host for larvae of froghoppers, known as spittlebugs.[6] Angophora hispida has been recorded as a host for the mistletoe species Muellerina eucalyptoides.[14] Use in horticulture This is a small tree suitable for larger gardens, its red new growth and profuse white flowers are attractive horticultural features. Flowering in summer, the flowers attract brightly coloured beetles.[15] It requires a sunny aspect and good drainage to grow well.

 Eucalyptus inopina (K.D.Hill) Brooker
 Angophora inopina, commonly known as the Charmhaven apple,[3] is a species of small, often multi-stemmed tree that is endemic to the Central Coast of New South Wales. It has rough bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white or creamy white flowers and ribbed, cup-shaped fruit.
 Description Angophora inopina is a tree, often multi-stemmed, that typically grows to a height of 8 m (26 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has greyish, fibrous bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have more or less sessile, egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves that are 40–70 mm (1.6–2.8 in) long, 15–30 mm (0.59–1.18 in) wide and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, leathery, usually glossy green but paler on the lower side, lance-shaped or curved, 45–120 mm (1.8–4.7 in) long and 8–30 mm (0.31–1.18 in) wide on a petiole 4–15 mm (0.16–0.59 in) long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets in groups of three or seven on a bristly, branched peduncle 3–27 mm (0.12–1.06 in) long, the individual buds on pedicels 7–12 mm (0.28–0.47 in) long. Mature buds are globe-shaped, 5–7 mm (0.20–0.28 in) long and wide with white or creamy white petals that are 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long and wide with a green keel. Flowering has been observed in December and the fruit is a bristly, cup-shaped capsule 6–13 mm (0.24–0.51 in) long and 9–15 mm (0.35–0.59 in) wide with longitudinal ribs and the valves enclosed in the fruit.[3][4][5][6] Taxonomy and naming Angophora inopina was first formally described in 1997 by Ken Hill from specimens collected near Charmhaven in the same year.[6][7] The specific epithet (inopina) is from the Latin inopinatus, meaning ""unexpected"", referring to the occurrence of this previously undescribed species near Sydney.[6][8] Distribution and habitat Charmhaven apple grows sandy soil over sandstone in woodland with a dense, shrubby understorey. It has a patchy distribution from Lake Macquarie to near the Hunter River and is most common in the Wyong and Lake Macquarie local government areas.[3][5][9][10] Conservation status This eucalypt is listed as ""vulnerable"" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The main threats to the species are habitat loss and fragmentation, changes to the water table, frequent fires, trampling and competition from weeds.[9] References","Angophora inopina is a tree, often multi-stemmed, that typically grows to a height of 8 m (26 ft) and forms a lignotuber.

 Angophora leiocarpa, commonly known as rusty gum,[2] is a species of small to medium-sized tree that is endemic to eastern Australia. It has smooth bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds usually in groups of three, white or creamy white flowers and smooth barrel-shaped to cup-shaped fruit.
 Description Angophora leiocarpa is a tree that typically grows to a height of 25 m (82 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth pink to orange or greyish bark that is shed in small patches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves that are narrow lance-shaped, 45–140 mm (1.8–5.5 in) long and 7–28 mm (0.3–1.1 in) wide with a stem-clasping base, and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped or curved, 55–160 mm (2.2–6.3 in) long and 6–25 mm (0.2–1.0 in) wide tapering to a petiole 6–15 mm (0.2–0.6 in) long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched, glabrous peduncle 9–32 mm (0.4–1.3 in) long, each branch of the peduncle with three, rarely seven buds, on pedicels 3–8 mm (0.1–0.3 in) long. Mature buds are globe-shaped, 4–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long and 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) wide with a smooth to slightly ribbed floral cup and petals about 3 mm (0.1 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) wide. Flowering has been observed from November to February and the fruit is a thin-walled, barrel-shaped to cup-shaped capsule 10–15 mm (0.4–0.6 in) long and 7–12 mm (0.3–0.5 in) wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit.[3][4][5][6] Taxonomy and naming Rusty gum was first formally described in 1986 by Gregory John Leach from an unpublished description by Lawrie Johnson and given the name Angophora costata subsp. leiocarpa from specimens collected near Warialda High School in 1976.[6][7] In 1988 Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges raised it to species status as Angophora leiocarpa.[8] The specific epithet leiocarpa is derived from the ancient Greek leios meaning 'smooth' and karpon 'fruit', distinguishing this Angophora from others in the genus.[6] A 2021 molecular analysis of the genus confirmed it was genetically divergent from the two A. costata subspecies, and in fact showed some hybridization with Angophora floribunda.[9] Distribution and habitat Angophora leiocarpa grows in open forest on sandstone hills and outcrops from Blackall and Mackay in Queensland, south to Narrabri and Grafton in New South Wales.[4][5] Gallery References","Angophora leiocarpa is a tree that typically grows to a height of 25 m (82 ft) and forms a lignotuber.

 Eucalyptus robur (L.A.S.Johnson & K.D.Hill) Brooker
 Angophora robur, commonly known as the sandstone rough-barked apple or the broad-leaved sandstone apple,[2] is a species of small tree that is endemic to a small area in New South Wales. It has rough, fibrous bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped to egg-shaped or oblong adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white or creamy white flowers and cup-shaped to bell-shaped fruit.
 Description Angophora robur is a tree that typically grows to a height of 10 m (33 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous, greyish bark on the trunk and branches, Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves that are lance-shaped to oblong, 80–150 mm (3.1–5.9 in) long and 20–50 mm (0.8–2.0 in) wide with a stem-clasping base and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped to egg-shaped or oblong, paler on the lower surface, 60–180 mm (2.4–7.1 in) long, 25–60 mm (1.0–2.4 in) wide and sessile. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle 15–35 mm (0.6–1.4 in) long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds on pedicels 8–23 mm (0.3–0.9 in) long. Mature buds are globe-shaped, 7–10 mm (0.3–0.4 in) long and 7–12 mm (0.3–0.5 in) long with a ribbed floral cup and white or creamy white petals with a green keel. Flowering has been observed in December and the  fruit is a cup-shaped to bell-shaped capsule 12–17 mm (0.5–0.7 in) long, 12–16 mm (0.5–0.6 in) wide and longitudinally ribbed with the valves enclosed in the fruit.[2][3][4][5] Taxonomy and naming Angophora robur was first formally described in 1990 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill in the journal Telopea from specimens they collected near Kremnos Creek on the Glenreagh - Grafton Road in 1984.[5][6] Genetic analysis shows it to be closely related to smudgee (Angophora woodsiana).[7] Distribution and habitat Sandstone rough-barked apple has a limited distribution near the coast of northern New South Wales along a sandstone belt running from near Glenreagh, north-west of Coffs Harbour to Coaldale north-west of Grafton. It grows in woodland on shallow sandstone soils.[2][4] Conservation status This eucalypt is listed as ""vulnerable"" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The main threats to the species are clearing for agriculture, too-frequent fires, widening of roads and timber harvesting.[8][9] References","Angophora robur is a tree that typically grows to a height of 10 m (33 ft) and forms a lignotuber.

 Actinodium cunninghamii, commonly known as swamp daisy or Albany daisy,[3] is the only formally described species in the genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae, Actinodium and is endemic to Western Australia.
 Description Actinodium cunninghamii is a small, compact shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 30 cm (12 in) with leaves about 4 mm (0.16 in) long and 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) wide. The flowers are borne in pinkish-brown, daisy-like heads 20–30 mm (0.79–1.18 in) in diameter. The heads are made up of tiny, bell-shaped flowers surrounded by sterile, strap-like ray flowers.[4][5] A related, but as yet undescribed species presently given the name Actinodium sp. 'Fitzgerald River' and also commonly known as Albany daisy, is a sparsely-branched shrub up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) high with leaves 5–6 mm (0.20–0.24 in) long, the heads pink and white and 40–50 mm (1.6–2.0 in) wide. This species is more common than A. cunninghamii.[4][6] Taxonomy The genus Actinodium was first formally described in 1836 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in the journal Linnaea, Ein Journal für die Botanik in ihrem ganzen Umfange[7][8] and Schauer later described Actinodium cunninghamii in John Lindley's A Natural System of Botany from specimens collected by Allan Cunningham.[9][10] The genus name is derived from Greek and means ""like the spokes of a wheel"".[6][11] Distribution and habitat Actinodium cunninghamii grows in moist, sandy soil in forest and kwongan and is uncommon in nature. Both species of Actinodium usually grow in winter-wet depressions in near-coastal areas near Albany in the south-west of Western Australia.[4][5][12] Use in horticulture Actinodium sp. 'Fitzgerald River' (sometimes as A. cunninghamii) has been grown in gardens but is a short-lived plant requiring good drainage and a sheltered position.

 Agonis baxteri is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It is an erect, sometimes bushy shrub with elliptic to egg-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, and usually white flowers with 23 to 32 stamens.
 Description Agonis baxteri is an upright, often spindly shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in), its branchlets usually glabrous. Its leaves are dark green, elliptic to egg-shaped or narrowly so, with the narrower end towards the base, mostly 25–55 mm (0.98–2.17 in) long and 7–20 mm (0.28–0.79 in) wide, usually with three longitudinal veins. The flowers are arranged in clusters 15–25 mm (0.59–0.98 in) in diameter with hairy, grey, more or less round bracts 2.5–3.5 mm (0.098–0.138 in) long and similar bracteoles. The flowers are usually white, 12–14 mm (0.47–0.55 in) in diameter with sepals 1.8–2.5 mm (0.071–0.098 in) long, the petals 5–9 mm (0.20–0.35 in) long, and usually 23 to 32 stamens mostly 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long. Flowering mainly occurs from October to December and the fruits are in clusters 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) wide. The species is superficially similar to Taxandria marginata.[2][3][4] Taxonomy In 1867, George Bentham described Melaleuca baxteri in Flora Australiensis from specimens collected by William Baxter at ""King George's Sound or to the eastward"".[5][6] In 2007, Judy Wheeler and Neville Marchant changed the name to Agonis baxteri in the journal Nuytsia.[2][7] The specific epithet (baxteri) honours the collector of the type specimens.[8] Distribution and habitat Agonis baxteri is found on sandplains, dunes, swamps, stony hills, disturbed and disturbed areas along the south coast in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia in the Esperance Plains and Mallee IBRA bioregions where it grows in sand and loam over quartzite, limestone or granite.[4] Conservation status This species is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.[4] References","Agonis baxteri is an upright, often spindly shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in), its branchlets usually glabrous.

 Agonis flexuosa, commonly known as peppermint,[2] is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia.  The Noongar peoples know the tree as wanil, wonnow, wonong[3] or wannang.[4] It is a tree or shrub with pendulous, very narrowly elliptic, narrowly elliptic or narrowly egg-shaped leaves, white flowers with 20 to 25 stamens opposite the sepals and broadly top-shaped to broadly cup-shaped capsules. 
 Description Agonis flexuosa is usually a tree that typically grows to a height of 10 m (33 ft), sometimes a wind-swept mallee or almost prostrate shrub. Its branchlets are often twisted or zig-zagged, and usually glabrous as they age. The leaves are very narrowly elliptic, narrowly elliptic or narrowly egg-shaped, 80–135 mm (3.1–5.3 in) long and 3.5–12 mm (0.14–0.47 in) wide and sessile or on a petiole up to 5 mm (0.20 in) long. The leaves sometimes have soft, silky hairs when young, but become glabrous as they age, and have a prominent mid-vein and usually two other veins. The flowers are arranged in clusters 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) wide with broadly egg-shaped bracts and elliptic bracteoles 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long. The floral tube is 1.5–2 mm (0.059–0.079 in) long and the sepals are 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long with silky, greyish hairs. The petals are white, spatula-shaped, 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) long and there are 20 to 25 stamens with 3 to 5, sometimes up to 7 opposite the sepals, but none opposite the petals. The filaments are 1–1.5 mm (0.039–0.059 in) long and the style 1–2.5 mm (0.039–0.098 in) long. Flowering occurs from July to December, and the capsule is broadly top-shaped to broadly cup-shaped, 2.5–4 mm (0.098–0.157 in) long, in clusters 6–10 mm (0.24–0.39 in) wide.[2][5][6] Taxonomy This species was first formally described in 1809 by Carl Ludwig Willdenow who gave it the name Metrosideros flexuosa in his Enumeratio Plantarum Horti Regii Botanici Berolinensis.[7][8] In 1830, Robert Sweet transferred the species to Agonis in his Hortus Britannicus.[9][10] The genus name Agonis comes from the Greek agon meaning 'a gathering' or 'collection', probably referring to the flower heads[11] and the specific epithet (flexuosa) is Latin for 'zig-zag', referring to the zig-zag branches.[12] In 1844, Johannes Conrad Schauer describes two varieties of A. flexuosa and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census:
 Distribution and habitat Agonis flexuosa var. flexuosa occurs in a range of habitats from coastal heath to woodland or forest and in a range of soils, in the Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren bioregions of south-western Western Australia,[5][16] and var. latifolia mainly grows in sandy soil in heath, shrubland or woodland between Walpole and Cheyne Beach in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Warren bioregions, with a record from the Stirling Range.[5][17] Uses Horticultural variants are probably derived from the widespread population, growing as shrubs or trees and perhaps being flowerless. Some commercially produced cultivars include Agonis ‘Belbra Gold’ and Agonis ‘Fairy Foliage’.[5] The Noongar peoples used the plant leaves as an antiseptic; sapling trunks were used as spear shafts and digging sticks.[4] References","Agonis flexuosa is usually a tree that typically grows to a height of 10 m (33 ft), sometimes a wind-swept mallee or almost prostrate shrub.

 Allosyncarpia ternata, commonly known as an-binik, is a species of rainforest trees constituting part of the botanical family Myrtaceae and included in the eucalypts group. The only species in its genus, it was described in 1981 by Stanley Blake of the Queensland Herbarium. They grow naturally into large, spreading, shady trees, and are endemic to the Northern Territory of Australia. They grow in sandstone gorges along creeks emerging from the Arnhem Land plateau.[1][2] The common name anbinik comes from the Kundedjnjenghmi and Kundjeyhmi dialects of Bininj Kunwok, spoken in West Arnhem Land. In other dialects, such as the Kunwinjku spoken in Gunbalanya, the tree is known as manbinik.[3] Distribution and habitat The tree dominates the closed monsoon rainforest communities along the sandstone escarpment of the western Arnhem Land Plateau.

 Angophora bakeri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved apple,[2] is a species of tree that is endemic to New South Wales. It has rough, fibrous bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white or creamy white flowers and oval to cylindrical fruit.
 Description Angophora bakeri is a tree that typically grows to a height of 10–18 m (33–59 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous grey bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have linear to narrow lance-shaped leaves that are more or less sessile, 50–100 mm (2.0–3.9 in) long, 4–10 mm (0.16–0.39 in) wide and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are thin, glossy green, paler on the lower surface, linear to narrow lance-shaped, 60–130 mm (2.4–5.1 in) long, 5–10 mm (0.2–0.4 in) wide on a petiole 3–10 mm (0.1–0.4 in) long, and arranged in opposite pairs. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets in groups of three or seven on a peduncle 7–18 mm (0.3–0.7 in) long, the individual buds on pedicels 4–11 mm (0.2–0.4 in) long. Mature buds are 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) long and 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) wide. There are five sepals up to 1 mm (0.04 in) long and the petals are about 3 mm (0.1 in) long and wide. Flowering occurs from December to February and the flowers are white or creamy white. The fruit is an oval to cylindrical, pale brown or grey capsule 8–10 mm (0.3–0.4 in) long and wide with ribbed sides.[2][3][4] Taxonomy and naming Angophora bakeri was first formally described in 1913 by Edwin Cuthbert Hall in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales.[5][6] The specific epithet honours Richard Thomas Baker.[4] In 1986, G.J.Leach described two subspecies in the journalTelopea and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census:[7] Distribution and habitat Narrow-leaved apple grows in sandy soil over sandstone and is widespread and locally abundant from Port Stephens to Nowra and as far west as Katoomba. There is also a disjunct population, previously known as Angophora exul, now a synonym of A. bakeri subsp. bakeri in the Gibraltar Range National Park.[2][4][3] Gallery References","Angophora bakeri is a tree that typically grows to a height of 10–18 m (33–59 ft) and forms a lignotuber.

 Metrosideros costata Gaertn.
 Angophora costata, commonly known as Sydney red gum, rusty gum or smooth-barked apple, is a species of tree that is endemic to eastern Australia. Reaching 30 m (100 ft)  in height, the species has distinctive smooth bark that is pinkish or orange-brown when new and fades to grey with age. Its lance-shaped leaves are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems, with white or creamy white flowers appearing from October to December. The flower buds are usually arranged in groups of three,  followed by ribbed, oval or bell-shaped fruit.
 Description Angophora costata is a tree that typically grows to a height of 30 m (100 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth pinkish or orange-brown bark that weathers to grey and is shed in small scales. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile, elliptical to egg-shaped leaves arranged in opposite pairs with a stem-clasping base, 60–125 mm (2.5–5 in) long and 20–65 mm (0.8–2.6 in) wide. Adult leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, glossy green but paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped or curved, 70–190 mm (2.8–7.5 in) long and 12–35 mm (0.5–1.4 in) wide on a petiole 9–25 mm (0.4–1.0 in) long. New leaf growth is strongly tinted with red. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle 3–25 mm (0.1–1.0 in) long, each branch of the peduncle with usually three buds on pedicels 3–15 mm (0.1–0.6 in) long. Mature buds are oval to globe-shaped, up to 10 mm (0.4 in) long and 11 mm (0.4 in) wide. There are five sepals up to 3 mm (0.1 in) long and the petals are white to creamy white with a green keel, 3–5 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long and 3–6 mm (0.1–0.2 in) wide. Flowering occurs from October to December. The fruit is an oval or bell-shaped capsule up to 20 mm (0.8 in) long and wide.[3][4][5] New seedlings have petiolate round cotyledon leaves 1.5 cm wide and long.[6] Taxonomy and naming Sydney red gum was first formally described in 1788 by German botanist Joseph Gaertner and given the name Metrosideros costata in his book De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum,[7] from material collected by surveyor David Burton around Port Jackson.[8] The specific epithet (costata) is a Latin word meaning 'ribbed'.[9] English botanist Richard Anthony Salisbury named it Metrisoderos apocynifolia in his 1796 work Prodromus stirpium in horto ad Chapel Allerton vigentium.[10]  Spanish taxonomist Antonio José Cavanilles erected the new genus Angophora in 1797 in his book Icones et Descriptiones Plantarum, giving the species the name Angophora lanceolata.[11] English botanist George Bentham used this last name in his Flora Australiensis in 1867.[12] English botanist James Britten changed the name to Angophora costata in the Journal of Botany, British and Foreign in 1916.[13][14] In 1986, Gregory John Leach described three subspecies in the journal Telopea and two names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census:[15] A third subspecies, subsp. leiocarpa was reclassified as a separate species Angophora leiocarpa.[19] A phylogenetic analysis of the genus published in 2021 confirmed its genetic distinctness from the two costata subspecies.[18] Recent genetic work has been published showing Angophora to be more closely related to Eucalyptus than Corymbia, and the name Eucalyptus apocynifolia has been proposed for this species if it were to be placed in the genus Eucalyptus.[20] This has not been taken up by the botanical community.[6] Common names include Sydney red gum, rusty gum, smooth-barked apple,[3] and smooth-barked angophora.[6] Aboriginal people from the Sydney region knew the tree as kajimbourra.[21] Distribution and habitat Angophora costata grows in sandy soil, often over sandstone and occurs naturally in Queensland and New South Wales. It is widely distributed in south-eastern Queensland and disjunctly in the White Mountains National Park. In New South Wales it mainly occurs in coastal areas south from Coffs Harbour to Narooma and as far west as the Blue Mountains.[3][4][5]
It is found from sea level to an altitude of 300 m (1,000 ft) in areas of predominantly summer rainfall receiving 600 to 1,200 mm (25 to 45 in) a year. Maximum temperatures across its range vary from 25 to 35 °C (77 to 95 °F) and minimum temperatures from 0 to 8 °C (32 to 46 °F), with anywhere from 0 to 50 days of frost.[6] In Victoria it is a commonly planted ornamental and is naturalised in some places.[5][22] It grows in open forest and woodland, in association with such species as Sydney peppermint (Eucalyptus piperita), bangalay (E. botryoides),[23] grey gum (E. punctata), blue-leaved stringybark (E. agglomerata), white mahogany (E. acmenoides), broad-leaved white mahogany (E. umbra), large-fruited red mahogany (E. scias),  red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), yellow bloodwood (C. eximia), pink bloodwood (C. intermedia) lemon-scented gum (C. citriodora),[6] turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), forest oak (Allocasuarina torulosa),[23] and cypress pines (Callitris species),[6] and in hind dune communities with wedding bush (Monotoca elliptica) and burrawang (Macrozamia communis).[23] Ecology Angophora costata trees can live over 100 years. The species responds to bushfire by resprouting from epicormic buds and its lignotuber; shoots on branches of older specimens arise after a month, while shoots resprout from the trunk and base of young plants within a month of a hot fire. Seedlings appear within 9 to 10 months.[23] The tree is parasitised by the long-flowered mistletoe (Dendrophthoe vitellina).[23] The flowers are eaten by the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) and little red flying fox (P. scapulatus), while the seed is eaten by the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans).[23] Although the bark of A. costata is smooth, many invertebrates are found there. Several spiders in the family Salticidae, including Servaea vestita, and pseudoscorpions live under loose bark. The flattened bug Stenocotis depressa evades detection by camouflage, and cockroaches and huntsman spiders live under the loose bark at the base of the trunk.[24] Angophora costata is also susceptible to the fungal pathogens Quambalaria pitotheka, Aulographina eucalypti and Cryptococcus neoformans.[25] Uses Smooth-barked apple grows well in a variety of situations and can be easily grown from seed in a loose, well-drained seed-raising mixture. Some specimens have a straight trunk while others have a more branching habit with twisted trunks. The tree sometimes sheds branches and should not be planted close to buildings.[26] The heartwood is hard though not durable. Pale pink-brown in colour, it has a density of 755–1045 kg/m3 and a coarse texture. It is not suitable for use on the ground,[6] though it has been used for fencing and rough flooring.[27] The pale sapwood has a width of up to 5 cm (2 in) and is susceptible to attack by borers of the genus Lyctus.[6] This tree produces abundant pollen but little nectar. and the honey produced is not highly regarded.[27] Significant individuals Angophora Reserve in the Sydney suburb of Avalon was named after a huge individual, reportedly around 300 years of age. That tree died in the late 20th century.[28] Also in Sydney, the upper Lane Cove River Valley has several large Sydney red gums, one near Conscript Pass was measured at 45 metres tall.[29] The largest known living tree in New Zealand (241 cm diameter) is located at Hobsonville near Auckland.[30] Gallery References","Angophora costata is a tree that typically grows to a height of 30 m (100 ft) and forms a lignotuber.

 Angophora floribunda, commonly known as the rough-barked apple,[2] is a common woodland and forest tree of the family Myrtaceae native to Eastern Australia. Reaching 30 m (100 ft) high, it is a large tree with fibrous bark and cream-white flowers that appear over the Austral summer. It grows on alluvial soils on floodplains and along watercourses. Much of the land it grew on has been cleared for agriculture.
 Description Angophora floribunda  is a large, wide, spreading tree growing to a height of 30 m (100 ft). The trunk is often gnarled and crooked with fibrous grey bark.[2] Like all members of the genus Angophora, the dull to glossy green leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem.  5.5 to 15 cm (2.2–6 in) long and 1–5 cm (0.4–2 in) wide. They are lanceolate to ovate and attached to the stems by  0.6–1.5 cm (0.2–0.6 in) long petioles. The leaves in the western parts of the range are narrower than those in more coastal regions.[3] The cream-white flowers appear from November to March.[4] It can be confused with A. subvelutina, but the latter has leaves that are heart-shaped at their base and lacking petioles, arise from the stem.[5] Taxonomy The rough-barked apple was described by James Edward Smith in 1797 as Metrosideros floribunda, having been collected by Surgeon-General of New South Wales, John White in 1794. It was growing from seed in Empress Josephine's arboretum at Malmaison by 1804, when Étienne Pierre Ventenat catalogued it in his  Jardin de la Malmaison.[6] The species name is derived from the Latin floribunda 'abundant flowers'.[7]Robert Sweet gave it its current name in 1830.[8] Common names include rough-barked apple, apple box, rusty gum, gum myrtle and Boondah.[8] Genetic work has been published showing Angophora to be more closely related to Eucalyptus than Corymbia, and in 2000 botanist Ian Brooker coined the name Eucalyptus florida  for this species as Eucalyptus floribunda and E. intermedia had already been used for other eucalypts.[9] This tree hybridises with the broad-leaved apple (Angophora subvelutina).[4] Genetic analysis suggests the two might be a single species, despite their different morphology. Hybridization is present in some populations where both taxa occur but not others.[10] The Charmhaven apple (Angophora inopina) from the vicinity of Wyee on the Central Coast of New South Wales is closely related and may be a dwarf form of A. floribunda.[3] Distribution and habitat The range is across eastern Australia, from Rolleston and Roma in central Queensland though eastern and central New South Wales and into eastern Victoria, where it is found at Mallacoota.[3] It is found on alluvial soils, generally on shale or basalt soils.[4] In open forest, it is associated with such trees as swamp she-oak (Casuarina glauca), white stringybark (Eucalyptus globoidea), blackbutt (E. pilularis), Blakelys red gum (E. blakelyi), forest red gum (E. tereticornis), brittle gum (E. mannifera), forest she-oak (Allocasuarina torulosa), grey gum (E. punctata), and broad-leaved white mahogany (E. umbra). In wetter forest, it grows alongside Sydney blue gum (E. saligna) and in closed forest alongside lillypilly (Syzygium smithii), cheese tree (Glochidion ferdinandi), Australian white birch (Schizomeria ovata) and sandpaper fig (Ficus coronata) and under emergent specimens of bangalay (E. botryoides), grey ironbark (E. paniculata) and turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera).[4] Ecology The rough-barked apple regenerates by regrowing from epicormic buds after bushfire. Trees live for more than a hundred years. The grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) and little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) eat the flowers, and the white-plumed honeyeater (Ptilotula penicillata) forages among the flowers.[4] The tree is used as a nesting site by the rare regent honeyeater  (Anthochaera phrygia).[4] The jewel beetle species Curis caloptera, Stigmodera andersoni, S. terminatis and S. vigilans also visit the flowers, the latter three species being fairly specific in their preference for Angophora floribunda.[11] The longhorn beetle species Paroplites australis and Agrianome spinicollis have been recorded from the rough-barked apple.[12] Angophora floribunda has been recorded as a host for several mistletoe species: Amyema bifurcata, A. miquelii, A. pendula, Dendrophthoe curvata, D. glabrescens, D. vitellina, Muellerina celastroides and M. eucalyptoides.[13] Female scarlet myzomelas (Myzomela sanguinolenta) have been observed tearing off bark to use in building their nests.[14] Cultivation This is a large plant generally unsuitable for any but the largest gardens.

 Eucalyptus hispida (Sm.) BrookerAngophora cordifolia Cav.
 Angophora hispida grows as a mallee, or as a tree to about 7 m (23 ft) in height.[2]
Its small size, especially when compared to its Angophora and Eucalyptus relatives, leads to it being known by the common name dwarf apple.[3] It is native to a relatively small patch of central New South Wales – from just south of Sydney up to the Gosford area. The plant's leaves are sessile (stalk-less) and hug the stem with heart-shaped bases. Its previous name – A. cordifolia – referred to these cordate leaves. Another distinctive feature is the red bristly hairs that cover the branchlets, flower bases and new growth. This leads to the specific epithet hispida (meaning 'bristly').
 Description Dwarf apple grows as a small tree or mallee to 7 m (23 ft) high. It has greyish flaky bark.[4] Like other members of the genus Angophora and unlike other eucalypts, the leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem.[5] Sitting on petiole 0–4 mm long, the leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, and measure 5–10 cm (2.0–3.9 in) in length and 3–4.5 cm (1.2–1.8 in) across, with a blunt rounded apex, and a cordate (heart-shaped) base.[4] They are pale yellow-green above and greyish on their undersurface.[5] New growth is covered in reddish hairs.[5] Flowering takes place from November to January.[6] The showy creamy-white flower heads are terminal and umbellate, each composed of three to seven flowers on 0.8–3.2 cm (0.31–1.26 in) long pedicels, which in turn branch off from a 1.5–7 cm (0.59–2.76 in) long peduncle. Like the new leaves and stems, developing buds are covered in reddish hair. Globular in shape with longitudinal ribbing, they grow to a diameter of 0.9–1.3 cm (0.35–0.51 in).[7] The flowers fall leaving the cup-shaped woody seed pods or fruit, which measure 1.5–2.6 cm (0.59–1.02 in) long and 1.3–2 cm (0.51–0.79 in) in diameter.[7] These shed the mature seed in February and March.[6] The oval-shaped seeds are brown and flat, measuring 0.8–1 cm (0.31–0.39 in) long.[7] Taxonomy Common names include dwarf apple and scrub apple,[6] and banda in the Cadigal language.[4] Loddiges Nursery called it the Rough Metrosideros[8] after the dwarf apple was described by James Edward Smith in 1797 as Metrosideros hispida, having been collected by Surgeon-General of New South Wales, John White in 1795.[8]Antonio José Cavanilles also described it the same year as Angophora cordifolia, having been collected somewhere near the shoreline in Port Jackson.[9] The latter name remained in use until 1976, when A. hispida was erected by Don Blaxell,[10]  who had established that Smith's name had been published four months earlier in May (contrasting with Cavanillles in September) of 1797.[11] Smith had been sent a specimen by Surgeon-General White, which flowered in 1798. He went on to publish a fuller description accompanied by an illustration by James Sowerby in 1805.[11] Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a phylogenetic study based on morphology and came up with the smudgy apple (Angophora woodsiana) as the dwarf apple's closest relative.[12] Brooker and colleagues consider it to be more closely related to the broad-leaved apple (A. subvelutina).[7] More recently, genetic work has been published showing Angophora to be more closely related to Eucalyptus than Corymbia, and the name Eucalyptus hispida has been proposed for this species if it were to be placed in the eucalypt genus.[13] Hybrids with Angophora costata and A. bakeri have been recorded.[6] Distribution and habitat Dwarf apple is found only in the Sydney Basin, as far south as O’Hares Creek off the Georges River, on dry sandstone soils low in nutrients. The associated plant communities are heath, scrubland or open woodland, with such species as scribbly gums (Eucalyptus racemosa and E. haemastoma), red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri), heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), rusty banksia (B. oblongifolia), silver banksia (B. marginata), conesticks (Petrophile pulchella), scrub sheoak (Allocasuarina distyla), wax flower (Eriostemon australasius) and parrot pea (Dillwynia floribunda).[6] It grows from sea level to an altitude of 300 m (980 ft) and with an annual rainfall of 800 to 1,600 mm (31 to 63 in).[6] Ecology Dwarf apple regenerates from bushfire by resprouting from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, or epicormic shoots. It can flower within a year of being burnt and plays an important role as a food source for nectar-eating insects after bushfire.[6] The flowers attract birds, such as the noisy miner and wattlebirds, and a wide variety of insects, including honeybees, native bees, flies, moths and butterflies, and a wide array of beetles, including the rose chafer (Eupoecila australasiae), green-velvet flower chafer (Glycyphana brunnipes), the variable jewel beetle (Temognatha variabilis), the cowboy beetle (Chondropyga dorsalis), and a scarab beetle Bisallardiana gymnopleura, as well as members of the scarab genus Phyllotocus and soldier beetle genus Telephorus.[6] The dwarf apple is a host for larvae of froghoppers, known as spittlebugs.[6] Angophora hispida has been recorded as a host for the mistletoe species Muellerina eucalyptoides.[14] Use in horticulture This is a small tree suitable for larger gardens, its red new growth and profuse white flowers are attractive horticultural features. Flowering in summer, the flowers attract brightly coloured beetles.[15] It requires a sunny aspect and good drainage to grow well.

The associated plant communities are heath, scrubland or open woodland, with such species as scribbly gums (Eucalyptus racemosa and E. haemastoma), red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri), heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), rusty banksia (B. oblongifolia), silver banksia (B. marginata), conesticks (Petrophile pulchella), scrub sheoak (Allocasuarina distyla), wax flower (Eriostemon australasius) and parrot pea (Dillwynia floribunda).[6] It grows from sea level to an altitude of 300 m (980 ft) and with an annual rainfall of 800 to 1,600 mm (31 to 63 in).[6] Ecology Dwarf apple regenerates from bushfire by resprouting from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, or epicormic shoots. It can flower within a year of being burnt and plays an important role as a food source for nectar-eating insects after bushfire.[6] The flowers attract birds, such as the noisy miner and wattlebirds, and a wide variety of insects, including honeybees, native bees, flies, moths and butterflies, and a wide array of beetles, including the rose chafer (Eupoecila australasiae), green-velvet flower chafer (Glycyphana brunnipes), the variable jewel beetle (Temognatha variabilis), the cowboy beetle (Chondropyga dorsalis), and a scarab beetle Bisallardiana gymnopleura, as well as members of the scarab genus Phyllotocus and soldier beetle genus Telephorus.[6] The dwarf apple is a host for larvae of froghoppers, known as spittlebugs.[6] Angophora hispida has been recorded as a host for the mistletoe species Muellerina eucalyptoides.[14] Use in horticulture This is a small tree suitable for larger gardens, its red new growth and profuse white flowers are attractive horticultural features. Flowering in summer, the flowers attract brightly coloured beetles.[15] It requires a sunny aspect and good drainage to grow well.

 Eucalyptus inopina (K.D.Hill) Brooker
 Angophora inopina, commonly known as the Charmhaven apple,[3] is a species of small, often multi-stemmed tree that is endemic to the Central Coast of New South Wales. It has rough bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white or creamy white flowers and ribbed, cup-shaped fruit.
 Description Angophora inopina is a tree, often multi-stemmed, that typically grows to a height of 8 m (26 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has greyish, fibrous bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have more or less sessile, egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves that are 40–70 mm (1.6–2.8 in) long, 15–30 mm (0.59–1.18 in) wide and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, leathery, usually glossy green but paler on the lower side, lance-shaped or curved, 45–120 mm (1.8–4.7 in) long and 8–30 mm (0.31–1.18 in) wide on a petiole 4–15 mm (0.16–0.59 in) long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets in groups of three or seven on a bristly, branched peduncle 3–27 mm (0.12–1.06 in) long, the individual buds on pedicels 7–12 mm (0.28–0.47 in) long. Mature buds are globe-shaped, 5–7 mm (0.20–0.28 in) long and wide with white or creamy white petals that are 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long and wide with a green keel. Flowering has been observed in December and the fruit is a bristly, cup-shaped capsule 6–13 mm (0.24–0.51 in) long and 9–15 mm (0.35–0.59 in) wide with longitudinal ribs and the valves enclosed in the fruit.[3][4][5][6] Taxonomy and naming Angophora inopina was first formally described in 1997 by Ken Hill from specimens collected near Charmhaven in the same year.[6][7] The specific epithet (inopina) is from the Latin inopinatus, meaning ""unexpected"", referring to the occurrence of this previously undescribed species near Sydney.[6][8] Distribution and habitat Charmhaven apple grows sandy soil over sandstone in woodland with a dense, shrubby understorey. It has a patchy distribution from Lake Macquarie to near the Hunter River and is most common in the Wyong and Lake Macquarie local government areas.[3][5][9][10] Conservation status This eucalypt is listed as ""vulnerable"" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.

 Angophora leiocarpa, commonly known as rusty gum,[2] is a species of small to medium-sized tree that is endemic to eastern Australia. It has smooth bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds usually in groups of three, white or creamy white flowers and smooth barrel-shaped to cup-shaped fruit.
 Description Angophora leiocarpa is a tree that typically grows to a height of 25 m (82 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth pink to orange or greyish bark that is shed in small patches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves that are narrow lance-shaped, 45–140 mm (1.8–5.5 in) long and 7–28 mm (0.3–1.1 in) wide with a stem-clasping base, and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped or curved, 55–160 mm (2.2–6.3 in) long and 6–25 mm (0.2–1.0 in) wide tapering to a petiole 6–15 mm (0.2–0.6 in) long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched, glabrous peduncle 9–32 mm (0.4–1.3 in) long, each branch of the peduncle with three, rarely seven buds, on pedicels 3–8 mm (0.1–0.3 in) long. Mature buds are globe-shaped, 4–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long and 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) wide with a smooth to slightly ribbed floral cup and petals about 3 mm (0.1 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) wide. Flowering has been observed from November to February and the fruit is a thin-walled, barrel-shaped to cup-shaped capsule 10–15 mm (0.4–0.6 in) long and 7–12 mm (0.3–0.5 in) wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit.[3][4][5][6] Taxonomy and naming Rusty gum was first formally described in 1986 by Gregory John Leach from an unpublished description by Lawrie Johnson and given the name Angophora costata subsp. leiocarpa from specimens collected near Warialda High School in 1976.[6][7] In 1988 Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges raised it to species status as Angophora leiocarpa.[8] The specific epithet leiocarpa is derived from the ancient Greek leios meaning 'smooth' and karpon 'fruit', distinguishing this Angophora from others in the genus.[6] A 2021 molecular analysis of the genus confirmed it was genetically divergent from the two A. costata subspecies, and in fact showed some hybridization with Angophora floribunda.[9] Distribution and habitat Angophora leiocarpa grows in open forest on sandstone hills and outcrops from Blackall and Mackay in Queensland, south to Narrabri and Grafton in New South Wales.[4][5] Gallery References","Angophora leiocarpa is a tree that typically grows to a height of 25 m (82 ft) and forms a lignotuber.

 Angophora robur, commonly known as the sandstone rough-barked apple or the broad-leaved sandstone apple,[2] is a species of small tree that is endemic to a small area in New South Wales. It has rough, fibrous bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped to egg-shaped or oblong adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white or creamy white flowers and cup-shaped to bell-shaped fruit.
 Description Angophora robur is a tree that typically grows to a height of 10 m (33 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous, greyish bark on the trunk and branches, Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves that are lance-shaped to oblong, 80–150 mm (3.1–5.9 in) long and 20–50 mm (0.8–2.0 in) wide with a stem-clasping base and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped to egg-shaped or oblong, paler on the lower surface, 60–180 mm (2.4–7.1 in) long, 25–60 mm (1.0–2.4 in) wide and sessile. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle 15–35 mm (0.6–1.4 in) long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds on pedicels 8–23 mm (0.3–0.9 in) long. Mature buds are globe-shaped, 7–10 mm (0.3–0.4 in) long and 7–12 mm (0.3–0.5 in) long with a ribbed floral cup and white or creamy white petals with a green keel. Flowering has been observed in December and the  fruit is a cup-shaped to bell-shaped capsule 12–17 mm (0.5–0.7 in) long, 12–16 mm (0.5–0.6 in) wide and longitudinally ribbed with the valves enclosed in the fruit.[2][3][4][5] Taxonomy and naming Angophora robur was first formally described in 1990 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill in the journal Telopea from specimens they collected near Kremnos Creek on the Glenreagh - Grafton Road in 1984.[5][6] Genetic analysis shows it to be closely related to smudgee (Angophora woodsiana).[7] Distribution and habitat Sandstone rough-barked apple has a limited distribution near the coast of northern New South Wales along a sandstone belt running from near Glenreagh, north-west of Coffs Harbour to Coaldale north-west of Grafton. It grows in woodland on shallow sandstone soils.[2][4] Conservation status This eucalypt is listed as ""vulnerable"" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The main threats to the species are clearing for agriculture, too-frequent fires, widening of roads and timber harvesting.[8][9] References","Angophora robur is a tree that typically grows to a height of 10 m (33 ft) and forms a lignotuber.

 Astartea fascicularis is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is endemic to southwestern Western Australia, where it is widespread in the Recherche Archipelago and present on the mainland in Cape Le Grand National Park. It is commonly known as Recherche astartea.[1] or false baeckea.[2] Description This species is a shrub usually reaching up to 1.5 metres tall at windy sites and about 3 metres in maximum height in sheltered areas. It may have single or multiple stems and may layer. New stems are reddish in colour and ridged or winged. Older stems are grey, developing reddish and grey stripes, and more deeply ridged. The leaves are often arranged in fascicles. The leaf blades may be as thick or thicker than they are wide, and reach 1.2 centimetres long. The flowers are paired along the branches. The petals are usually white, or sometimes pale pink. The flower contains clusters of several stamens and usually a few staminodes. The fruit capsule is 2 or 3 millimetres long.[1] Distribution It has a scattered distribution in the South West, Great Southern and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia where it is often found along watercourses and in winter wet depressions growing in 
sandy and lateritic soils.[3] This shrub grows on granite substrates. It occurs in exposed coastal habitat and more protected inland scrubs.[1] References External links","This species is a shrub usually reaching up to 1.5 metres tall at windy sites and about 3 metres in maximum height in sheltered areas.

 Austromyrtus dulcis is a species of plant native to eastern Australia. It grows as a small spreading shrub and is easily recognised by its characteristic berries that usually ripen in summer and autumn.[2] Common names include the midgen berry, midyim, and silky myrtle.[2] Description Austromyrtus dulcis is a small spreading shrub; 1 to 2 m (3 ft 3 in to 6 ft 7 in) in height. The leaves are 1–3 cm long and 0.5 cm wide, opposite, lanceolate to elliptical, glossy above with silky hairs beneath. The small white flowers are 7-10 mm in length, they have five petals and a large number of sepals, they are then followed by dotted mauve sweet edible berries which ripen in summer and autumn and contain three to nine pale brown seeds.[3][4] Distribution and habitat The species occurs in New South Wales and Queensland,[5] from Grafton to Fraser Island. It occurs as a common understorey plant of heathland and woodlands and also growing on sandy soils and occasionally on the margins of rainforests.[2][4] Uses The berries are a popular traditional bushfood, eaten by indigenous Australians and non-indigenous people. The melt-in-the-mouth berries are sweet and aromatic, with a pleasant peppery/gingery flavour. While recognized as having good flavour qualities, the berries have not been commercialized due to harvesting and handling issues.
 Midgim is also popular in amenity horticulture as an adaptable shrub for a variety of situations, handling a range of soils and climatic conditions.
 It springs up and grows like a wheat field .... one can go through acres of the scrub with its white, sweet-tasting berry until stopped by lagoon or salt water. It is the most sought-for berry or fruit on the island. Children will collect it by the tin-full, and even the elders will join with gusto in its eating.

 Taxonomy This species was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham in Compositae  Flora Australiensis, who gave it the name Baeckea grandiflora, from specimens collected by James Drummond between the Moore and Murchison Rivers.[3] In 2015, Barbara Rye transferred the species to Babingtonia as B. grandiflora in the journal Nuytsia.[4][5] The specific epithet (grandiflora) means ""large-flowered"".[6] Description Babingtonia grandiflora is an upright, open shrub, that typically grows to a height of 0.5 to 2 metres (2 to 7 ft) and has erect or arching stems. Its leaves are arranged opposite, widely spaced, either decussate or clustered on smaller branches, 2.5 to 10 millimetres (0.10 to 0.39 in) long, 0.5–1.6 mm (0.020–0.063 in) wide, 0.3–0.6 mm (0.012–0.024 in) thick. They can be more or less triangular to rounded or slightly pointed at the apex to terete with the narrower end towards the base, 2.5–9 mm (0.098–0.354 in) long and 0.5–1.6 mm (0.020–0.063 in) wide on a petiole 0.2–0.7 mm (0.0079–0.0276 in) long. The large, single, flowers are usually arranged singly on a pedicel 1–4 mm (0.039–0.157 in) long or multiple flowers on a peduncle 3–9 mm (0.12–0.35 in) long. The sepals are about 0.2–0.7 mm (0.0079–0.0276 in) long and 1.5–3.3 mm (0.059–0.130 in) wide. The petals are white or pale pink, 4.5–6.5 mm (0.18–0.26 in) long and there are 11–25 stamens in each flower. The flowers have a diameter of 10 to 15 mm (0.39 to 0.59 in).[2][7][8] The ovary has three locules, each with 10 to 15 ovules. Flowering mainly occurs from August to October, and the fruit is a capsule 2.5–3 mm (0.098–0.118 in) long and 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) wide including the flower parts.[4][2] Distribution and habitat Babingtonia grandiflora often occurs on plains, or on undulating hills and breakaways in the rocky hillsides, or outcrops from near Northampton to Boonanarring Nature Reserve in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and the Swan Coastal Plain bioregions of south-western Western Australia where it grows on gravelly loamy and sandy soils over laterite.[4][2]  References","Babingtonia grandiflora is an upright, open shrub, that typically grows to a height of 0.5 to 2 metres (2 to 7 ft) and has erect or arching stems.

 Babingtonia urbana, commonly known as coastal plain babingtonia,[2] is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It is a shrub with linear leaves and white or pale pink flowers usually arranged singly in leaf axils, each flower with 16 to 20 stamens in a circle.
 Description Babingtonia urbana is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 40–70 cm (16–28 in). The leaves are more or less linear, 6–13 mm (0.24–0.51 in) long and 0.7–1.2 mm (0.028–0.047 in) wide on a petiole 0.5–0.7 mm (0.020–0.028 in) long. Both surfaces of the leaves have rows of conspicuous oil glands on each side of the mid-vein. The flowers are usually arranged singly in leaf axils on a pedicel 0.7–1.5 mm (0.028–0.059 in) long with bracteoles up to 1.8 mm (0.071 in) long at the base but that fall off as the flowers open. The sepals are usually deep pink, 0.6–0.8 mm (0.024–0.031 in) long and 1.8–2.2 mm (0.071–0.087 in) wide and the petals are white or pale pink, 2.5–3.0 mm (0.098–0.118 in) long with usually 16 to 20 stamens in a circle. The ovary has three locules and the style is 1.5–3 mm (0.059–0.118 in) long. Flowering occurs from January to March, and the fruit is a capsule 2.2–2.5 mm (0.087–0.098 in) long and 2.5–3.0 mm (0.098–0.118 in) in diameter.[2][3] Taxonomy Babingtonia urbana was first formally described in 2015 by Barbara Rye and Malcolm Trudgen in the journal Nuytsia from specimens collected west of Mundijong by Greg Keighery in 1992.[4] The specific epithet (urbana) means ""of the city"", referring to the species occurring in areas of high human population.[3] Distribution and habitat This species grows in wetland mainly between Badgingarra National Park and Mundijong in the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion of south-western Western Australia.[2][3] Conservation status Babingtonia urbana is listed as ""Priority Three"" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions,[2] meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.[5] References","Babingtonia urbana is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 40–70 cm (16–28 in).

 Backhousia angustifolia, with common name narrow leaf myrtle,[1] is a flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae, native to Queensland and northeastern New South Wales.[2] References",NA,NA,NA,NA References,NA,NA,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backhousia_angustifolia,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

 Backhousia citriodora, commonly known as lemon myrtle, lemon scented myrtle or lemon scented ironwood, is a flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the subtropical rainforests of central and south-eastern Queensland, Australia, with a natural distribution from Mackay to Brisbane.[1] Description and ecology The species can reach 6 m (20 ft) in height, but is often smaller. The leaves are evergreen, opposite, lanceolate, 5–12 cm (2.0–4.7 in) long and 1.5–2.5 cm (0.6–1.0 in) broad, glossy green, with an entire margin. The flowers are creamy-white, 5–7 mm (0.20–0.28 in) in diameter, produced in clusters at the ends of the branches from summer through to autumn. After petal fall, the calyx is persistent.
 A significant fungal pathogen, myrtle rust (Uredo rangelii) was detected in lemon myrtle plantations in January 2011.[2][3] Myrtle rust severely damages new growth and threatens lemon myrtle production.
 Etymology Lemon myrtle was given the botanical name Backhousia citriodora by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1853 after his friend, the English botanist, James Backhouse.
 The common name reflects the strong lemon smell of the crushed leaves. 'Lemon scented myrtle' was the primary common name until the shortened trade name, 'lemon myrtle', was created by the native foods industry to market the leaf for culinary use. Lemon myrtle is now the more common name for the plant and its products.
 Lemon myrtle is sometimes confused with 'lemon ironbark', which is Eucalyptus staigeriana. Other common names are  sweet verbena tree, lemon scented verbena (not to be confused with lemon verbena), and sweet verbena myrtle.
 Uses Aboriginal Australians have long used lemon myrtle, both in cuisine and as a healing plant. The oil has the highest citral purity; typically higher than lemongrass. It is also considered to have a ""cleaner and sweeter"" aroma than comparable sources of citral–lemongrass and Litsea cubeba.[4] In 1888, Bertram first isolated the essential oil from B. citriodora.[5] In 1925, it was found to be significantly germicidal, and it was later shown to be antimicrobial.[6] In the 1940s, Tarax was the first company to use B. citriodora oil as a lemon flavouring during World War II.[7] In 1989, B. citriodora was investigated as a potential leaf spice and commercial crop by Peter Hardwick, who commissioned the Wollongbar Agricultural Institute to analyse B. citriodora selections using gas chromatography.[8] In 2001, a Standards for Oil of B. citriodora was established by The Essential Oils Unit, Wollongbar, and Standards Australia.[9] Lemon myrtle is one of the well known bushfood flavours and is sometimes referred to as the ""Queen of the lemon herbs"".[10] The leaf is often used as dried flakes, or in the form of an encapsulated flavour essence for enhanced shelf-life. It has a range of uses, such as lemon myrtle flakes in shortbread; flavouring in pasta; whole leaf with baked fish; infused in macadamia or vegetable oils; and made into tea, including tea blends. It can also be used as a lemon flavour replacement in milk-based foods, such as cheesecake, lemon flavoured ice-cream and sorbet without the curdling problem associated with lemon fruit acidity.[citation needed] Backhousia citriodora has two essential oil chemotypes. The citral chemotype is more prevalent and is cultivated in Australia for flavouring and essential oil. Citral as an isolate in steam distilled lemon myrtle oil is typically 90–98%, and oil yield 1–3% from fresh leaf. The citronellal chemotype is uncommon, and can be used as an insect repellent.[11][12] The dried leaf has free radical scavenging ability.[13] Lemon myrtle essential oil possesses antimicrobial properties; however, the undiluted essential oil is toxic to human cells in vitro.[14] When diluted to approximately 1%, absorption through the skin and subsequent damage is thought to be minimal.[15] Lemon myrtle oil has a high Rideal–Walker coefficient, a measure of antimicrobial potency.[16] Use of lemon myrtle oil as a treatment for skin lesions caused by molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), a disease typically affecting children and immuno-compromised patients, has been investigated. Nine of sixteen patients who were treated with 10% strength lemon myrtle oil showed a significant improvement, compared to none in the control group.[17] A study in 2003 which investigated the effectiveness of different preparations of lemon myrtle against bacteria and fungi concluded that the plant had potential as an antiseptic or as a surface disinfectant, or as an anti-microbial food additive.[18] The oil is a popular ingredient in health care and cleaning products, especially soaps, lotions, skin-whitening preparations and shampoos.[19] Cultivation Lemon myrtle is a cultivated ornamental plant. It can be grown from tropical to warm temperate climates, and may handle cooler districts provided it can be protected from frost when young.[1] In cultivation it rarely exceeds about 5 metres (16 ft) and usually has a dense canopy. The principal attraction to gardeners is the lemon smell, which perfumes both the leaves and flowers of the tree. Lemon myrtle is a hardy plant, which tolerates all but the poorest drained soils.[1] It can be slow growing but responds well to slow-release fertilisers.
 Seedling lemon myrtle go through a shrubby, slow juvenile growth stage, before developing a dominant trunk. Lemon myrtle can also be propagated from cutting, but is slow to strike.[1] A study into the plant growing adventitious roots found that ""actively growing axillary buds, wide stems and mature leaves"" are good indicators that a cutting will take root successfully and survive.[20] A further study on temperature recommended glasshouses for growing cuttings throughout the year.[21] Growing cuttings from mature trees bypasses the shrubby juvenile stage. Cutting propagation is also used to provide a consistent product in commercial production.
 In plantation cultivation the tree is typically maintained as a shrub by regular harvesting from the top and sides. Mechanical harvesting is used in commercial plantations. It is important to retain some lower branches when pruning for plant health. The harvested leaves are dried for leaf spice, or distilled for the essential oil.
 The majority of commercial lemon myrtle is grown in Queensland and the north coast of New South Wales, Australia.
 A 2009 study has suggested that drying lemon myrtle leaves at higher temperatures improves the citral content of the dried leaves, but discolours the leaves more.[22] See also References Further reading External links",NA,NA,NA,Further reading References,NA,NA,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backhousia_citriodora,NA,NA,"Aboriginal Australians have long used lemon myrtle, both in cuisine and as a healing plant.

The citronellal chemotype is uncommon, and can be used as an insect repellent.[11][12] The dried leaf has free radical scavenging ability.[13] Lemon myrtle essential oil possesses antimicrobial properties; however, the undiluted essential oil is toxic to human cells in vitro.[14] When diluted to approximately 1%, absorption through the skin and subsequent damage is thought to be minimal.[15] Lemon myrtle oil has a high Rideal–Walker coefficient, a measure of antimicrobial potency.[16] Use of lemon myrtle oil as a treatment for skin lesions caused by molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), a disease typically affecting children and immuno-compromised patients, has been investigated. Nine of sixteen patients who were treated with 10% strength lemon myrtle oil showed a significant improvement, compared to none in the control group.[17] A study in 2003 which investigated the effectiveness of different preparations of lemon myrtle against bacteria and fungi concluded that the plant had potential as an antiseptic or as a surface disinfectant, or as an anti-microbial food additive.[18] The oil is a popular ingredient in health care and cleaning products, especially soaps, lotions, skin-whitening preparations and shampoos.[19] Cultivation Lemon myrtle is a cultivated ornamental plant. It can be grown from tropical to warm temperate climates, and may handle cooler districts provided it can be protected from frost when young.[1] In cultivation it rarely exceeds about 5 metres (16 ft) and usually has a dense canopy. The principal attraction to gardeners is the lemon smell, which perfumes both the leaves and flowers of the tree. Lemon myrtle is a hardy plant, which tolerates all but the poorest drained soils.[1] It can be slow growing but responds well to slow-release fertilisers.
 Seedling lemon myrtle go through a shrubby, slow juvenile growth stage, before developing a dominant trunk. Lemon myrtle can also be propagated from cutting, but is slow to strike.[1] A study into the plant growing adventitious roots found that ""actively growing axillary buds, wide stems and mature leaves"" are good indicators that a cutting will take root successfully and survive.[20] A further study on temperature recommended glasshouses for growing cuttings throughout the year.[21] Growing cuttings from mature trees bypasses the shrubby juvenile stage. Cutting propagation is also used to provide a consistent product in commercial production.
 In plantation cultivation the tree is typically maintained as a shrub by regular harvesting from the top and sides. Mechanical harvesting is used in commercial plantations. It is important to retain some lower branches when pruning for plant health. The harvested leaves are dried for leaf spice, or distilled for the essential oil.
 The majority of commercial lemon myrtle is grown in Queensland and the north coast of New South Wales, Australia.
 A 2009 study has suggested that drying lemon myrtle leaves at higher temperatures improves the citral content of the dried leaves, but discolours the leaves more.[22] See also References Further reading External links",External links Further reading,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

 Backhousia leptopetala (syn. Choricarpia leptopetala) is a common Australian tree, growing from Stanwell Park (34° S) in the northern Illawarra district to near Buderim (26° S) in south eastern Queensland.
 Common names include brown myrtle, never-break, brush turpentine and rusty turpentine.  The habitat of Backhousia leptopetala is rainforest on the poorer sedimentary soils, near streams. It is also seen in moist eucalyptus areas on ridges. It may be identified by the greyish fawn colour under the leaf, and rusty hairy branchlets.
 Description Backhousia leptopetala is a small tree, occasionally reaching 20 metres in height and 35 cm in trunk diameter. The tree has attractive displays of cream flowers and appealing foliage.
 The bark is a greyish brown, relatively soft, flaky or corky. The trunk is somewhat fluted and irregular. Larger trees are flanged at the base.
 The leaves are opposite, simple and entire, broad with a fine leaf tip, and around 5 to 13 cm long. The edges of the leaves are curled over and wavy, mid-green above, but a greyish fawny green underneath. The midrib is sunken on the top surface, but venation is prominent under the leaf. Near the wavy leaf edge is an intramarginal vein, which is not always easily seen. The underside of the leaf is covered in tiny hairs.
 Flowers are small, cream or white, densely together in globular heads, appearing in July to September. From a distance, its flowers resemble the Callicoma.
 The fruit matures from August to November, being mostly a two-celled capsule, around 13 mm in diameter. Fresh seed is recommended for germination. Cuttings are not a successful method of regeneration.

 Backhousia myrtifolia (commonly referred to as carrol, neverbreak, iron wood, grey myrtle or cinnamon myrtle)  is a small rainforest tree species which grows in subtropical rainforests of Eastern Australia.[1][2][3] First discovered and subsequently used by the indigenous communities of Australia, this plant produces oils that have a cinnamon-like aroma, and display both anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties.[4] Therefore, it has potential applications as not only a spice in food preparation, but also in the medical field as a treatment option for microbial infection.[4]Backhousia myrtifolia can grow up to 30 metres. The leaves are ovate or elliptic, 4–7 cm long, and the flowers star-shaped in appearance.[5] Backhousia Myrtifolia is renowned for the snow-white colour of its flowers, a characteristic that makes it suitable not only as a domestic/commercial crop but also as an internationally exported product.[6] However, the susceptibility of this plant to ""post-harvest browning syndrome"" (a disease resulting in leaf discolouration and wilting), threatens its potential as a crop plant.[7] Characteristics B. myrtifolia is a native Australian species that belongs to the Myrtaceae family.[7]B. myrtifolia is a canopy species of plant (occupying high light environments) that form coppiced thick trunks, and tend to grow in warmer, temperate rainforest conditions.[1] They are most often found in regions close to watering bodies, such as the Eastern coastal edges of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.[1] Its most common locations include the South Coast of NSW in Bega, and off Fraser Island in Queensland. B.myrtifolia is an evergreen and has an average life-expectancy of between 80 and 100 years.[7] These plants tend to bloom between late spring and early summer, producing ivory white starfish-shaped flowers with 5 individual sepals and capsule like fruiting bodies.[8] Lastly, oil glands are visible as fine white dots throughout the leaf's structure and are responsible for the release of four major organic compounds: methyl eugenol, (E)-methyl isoeugenol, elemicin and (E)-isoelemicin which collectively produce the plant's distinct cinnamon-like aroma.[9] Backhousia myrtifolia was first documented and subsequently named after an English botanist James Backhouse (1794–1869), in his report on Australian landscape and wildlife titled A narrative of a visit to the Australian colonies.[10] James Backhouse was renowned not only for his publications in the field of botany, but also the friendships he formed with the indigenous Australians, whose land he was conducting research on.[10] However, prior to this B. myrtifolia  was used extensively by indigenous Australians as a spice in cooking, due to its unique aroma and widespread accessibility.[citation needed] Common diseases and cultivation options B. myrtifolia species is fast-growing (as measured by plant biomass, leaf area and leaf biomass per plant) under ideal conditions, which includes fertile soil, high irradiance levels and sufficient water supplies.[1] Maximum growth is achieved in the presence of oxygen-rich air (minimal carbon or nitric oxide pollutants) as well as nutrient-abundant soil, rich in micro-organism and mineral diversity.[11] In addition to this B.myrtifolia tolerates drought, periods of inundation and repeated root disturbance, meaning that they are capable of flourishing in areas that experience constant temperature, and weather fluctuations.[4] Therefore, this plant is suitable for cultivation in both domestic and commercial Australian environments (gardens or on footpaths) in both tropical (higher rainfall) and coastal climates.[5] In these urban settings Backhousia myrtifolia has an average life expectancy of 60 years, requiring very little maintenance, presuming it receives consistently high sunlight levels.[4] This is ideal for domestic governments and councils, since it minimises the costs associated with plant watering, trimming and root clearance.[citation needed] However, despite these seemingly ideal properties for domestic cultivation, the species is particularly susceptible to a condition termed ""post-harvest browning syndrome"", which involves the discolouration, browning and wilting of the plant's stereotypically dark green leaves.[12][8][2] This browning syndrome was first documented between July and September 2008, on a 4-year stock of B. Myrt folia plants located at the University of Queensland.[13] The discoloration was visible initially as small black dots on the surface of the leaves, progressing later into larger brown stained regions.[14] This condition affected approximately 30% of the harvested plants, signifying it infects populations of {B. Myrt folia randomly, in non-specific quantities.[15] Although research is still being conducted into its causes, ""post-harvest browning syndrome"" has been attributed to two primary factors:
 Infection of B. myrtifolia by the fungus Alternaria alternata was analysed and confirmed via Koch's postulates (a series of tests used to analyse the pathogenicity of certain bacteria and fungi).[17] Alternaria alternata was found to release certain low-molecular weight host-specific toxins (HSTs) such as tenuazonic acid, tentoxin and zinniol .[17] These toxins not only damage plant cell membranes but also cause permeability changes in the cell wall, that may contribute to plant browning and death .[16][17] In addition to this, these HST toxins may also cause disruptions in the oil gland structure of the plant's leaves, resulting in oil leakage.[12] The leakage of the plant's 4 oil chemotypes damages the efficiency of sunlight capture by chlorophylls (decreased chlorophyll fluorescence) resulting ultimately in the development of black and brown spots along the leaves' surface.[14] On the other hand, prolonged exposure to heat stress, was also found to produce free radicals in the leaves of B. myrtifolia plants.[2][15] These radicals oxidise the lipoprotein membranes surrounding cells, resulting in a loss of cellular compartmentalisation and structure, once again damaging chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence.[2] This is thought to be another significant contributing factor to the high rates of browning observed for this particular plant.[15] Therefore, it is recommended that B. myrtifolia be kept at temperatures above  in the presence of above 20mL of water, to prevent the development of post-harvest browning syndrome.[15] This browning of leaves not only damages the visual appearance of B. myrtifolia leaves, but also eliminates the recognisable cinnamon aroma produced by the oils of the plant.[8] Therefore, since no treatment options currently exist for ""post-harvest browning syndrome"" (despite its high frequency), the viability of B. myrtifolia as a domestic product is decreased considerably.[citation needed] Possible uses of Backhousia myrtifolia Backhousia myrtifolia is used extensively as an aromatic/spice, due to the unique properties of its natural oils; methyl eugenol and elemicin. These oils combine to produce a natural cinnamon-like fragrance, and as a result B. myrtifolia can be used as a flavouring agent in biscuits, stews and deserts.[18] In addition to this the B. myrtifolia plant is rich in fibres, vitamins (Vitamin A, C, E, K and pyridoxine) and minerals (potassium, calcium and copper) which are important in maintaining homeostatic body function.[18] Vitamins function as co-enzymes in the body, accelerating the rate of biological reactions, whilst minerals such as potassium are useful in preserving cellular electrochemical gradients, and thus maintaining musculoskeletal function.[19] Despite this, research is also being conducted into B. myrtifolia's application as an anti-bacterial or anti-fungal agent, due to the bactericidal properties of its oils.[citation needed] The methyl eugenol and elemicin components of B. myrtifolia's natural oils are very potent anti-septic agents, capable of inhibiting the growth of over 100 species of bacteria cumulatively.[citation needed]  The methyl eugenol oil of B. myrtifolia is capable of breaking down the thick peptidoglycan wall of gram positive bacteria whilst, elemicin creates small pores in the outer lipopolysaccharide layer of gram negative bacteria.[citation needed] Through both these mechanisms, B. myrtifolia is capable of exposing the interior of bacterial cells, to the external environment, therefore killing them.[citation needed] Consequently, the Aqueous and methanolic leaf extracts of B. Myrtifolia were found to inhibit the growth of both Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli bacteria.[citation needed] Infection by the P. mirabilis bacterium is responsible for between 1-10% of urinary tract infections and has also been linked as a causative agent of rheumatoid arthritis, whilst E. coli is generally responsible for gastro-intestinal infections such as food poisoning.[20] In addition to this, the oils produced by the B. myrtifolia plants are non-toxic (as determined by an Artemia franciscana nauplii bioassay) further supporting their use as either an internal or topical treatment for bacterial/fungal infections.[citation needed] In this same vein of thought, the anti-septic properties of Backhousia myrtifolia's oils also make it suitable for use as an insect repellent against common disease-carrying arthropods such as mosquitoes, flies and beetles.[21] Elemicin, a compound derived from the oils of B. myrtifolia leaves can replace substances such as citronella oil, which is the common active ingredient in candle and torch insect repellents.[22] The resultant naturally sourced insect repellents, would be especially useful to individuals who suffer allergic reactions to the chemicals present in conventional repellents (diethyl phthalate, dimethyl carbate etc.).[22] In countries such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, where the rates of mosquito spread malaria and West Nile virus are high, B. myrtifolia based repellents would be especially useful.[21] Backhousia myrtifolia as an exported product B. myrtifolia is a desired product for international exportation (particularly to Asian regions such as Japan) due to the unique ivory-white colour of its flowers. Initially, between 1995 and 2000 the profits made through exportation, specifically around the holiday season were high, since the flower was labelled ""the Christmas Carol"" by Australian farmers.[23] Therefore, the plant was exported mainly due to its aesthetic qualities rather than its medicinal or food-related uses. To match the slowly increasing demand for the plant in various countries including Asia and Western Europe, Australians in southern NSW began to develop farms dedicated to its production.[6] However, through mismanagement, ineffective sales tactics, and the increasing prevalence of ""post-harvest browning syndrome"" the popularity of the plant decreased by over 40% in 2004.[6] The  browning syndrome was reported to infect up to 20% of all exported plants causing a drop in the average exported plant quality from a rating of 2.75 (classified as ideal quality and freshness) to 1.75 (acceptable quality).[15] The B. Myrtifolia market was dependent entirely on plant quality and appearance, and therefore as this began to decrease so did the profits generated by the industry.[6] In response to this Australian growers and exporters in 2004, congregated to form the Backhousia Group, an organisation determined to improve sales, through more efficient farming techniques and aggressive sales campaigns.[23] The development of this value chain alliance in 2004, helped restore the Backhousia botanical industry, to a profitable margin within a period of two years.[6] Furthermore, with the uses of the plant now expanded, its potential as an exported product for antibacterial, cooking or repellent purposes may grow.[citation needed] References Further reading External links",NA,NA,NA,Further reading References,NA,NA,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backhousia_myrtifolia,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA External links,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,External links Further reading,"B. myrtifolia is a native Australian species that belongs to the Myrtaceae family.[7]B. myrtifolia is a canopy species of plant (occupying high light environments) that form coppiced thick trunks, and tend to grow in warmer, temperate rainforest conditions.[1] They are most often found in regions close to watering bodies, such as the Eastern coastal edges of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.[1] Its most common locations include the South Coast of NSW in Bega, and off Fraser Island in Queensland.

These oils combine to produce a natural cinnamon-like fragrance, and as a result B. myrtifolia can be used as a flavouring agent in biscuits, stews and deserts.[18] In addition to this the B. myrtifolia plant is rich in fibres, vitamins (Vitamin A, C, E, K and pyridoxine) and minerals (potassium, calcium and copper) which are important in maintaining homeostatic body function.[18] Vitamins function as co-enzymes in the body, accelerating the rate of biological reactions, whilst minerals such as potassium are useful in preserving cellular electrochemical gradients, and thus maintaining musculoskeletal function.[19] Despite this, research is also being conducted into B. myrtifolia's application as an anti-bacterial or anti-fungal agent, due to the bactericidal properties of its oils.[citation needed] The methyl eugenol and elemicin components of B. myrtifolia's natural oils are very potent anti-septic agents, capable of inhibiting the growth of over 100 species of bacteria cumulatively.[citation needed]  The methyl eugenol oil of B. myrtifolia is capable of breaking down the thick peptidoglycan wall of gram positive bacteria whilst, elemicin creates small pores in the outer lipopolysaccharide layer of gram negative bacteria.[citation needed] Through both these mechanisms, B. myrtifolia is capable of exposing the interior of bacterial cells, to the external environment, therefore killing them.[citation needed] Consequently, the Aqueous and methanolic leaf extracts of B. Myrtifolia were found to inhibit the growth of both Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli bacteria.[citation needed] Infection by the P. mirabilis bacterium is responsible for between 1-10% of urinary tract infections and has also been linked as a causative agent of rheumatoid arthritis, whilst E. coli is generally responsible for gastro-intestinal infections such as food poisoning.[20] In addition to this, the oils produced by the B. myrtifolia plants are non-toxic (as determined by an Artemia franciscana nauplii bioassay) further supporting their use as either an internal or topical treatment for bacterial/fungal infections.[citation needed] In this same vein of thought, the anti-septic properties of Backhousia myrtifolia's oils also make it suitable for use as an insect repellent against common disease-carrying arthropods such as mosquitoes, flies and beetles.[21] Elemicin, a compound derived from the oils of B. myrtifolia leaves can replace substances such as citronella oil, which is the common active ingredient in candle and torch insect repellents.[22] The resultant naturally sourced insect repellents, would be especially useful to individuals who suffer allergic reactions to the chemicals present in conventional repellents (diethyl phthalate, dimethyl carbate etc.).[22] In countries such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, where the rates of mosquito spread malaria and West Nile virus are high, B. myrtifolia based repellents would be especially useful.[21] Backhousia myrtifolia as an exported product B. myrtifolia is a desired product for international exportation (particularly to Asian regions such as Japan) due to the unique ivory-white colour of its flowers. Initially, between 1995 and 2000 the profits made through exportation, specifically around the holiday season were high, since the flower was labelled ""the Christmas Carol"" by Australian farmers.[23] Therefore, the plant was exported mainly due to its aesthetic qualities rather than its medicinal or food-related uses. To match the slowly increasing demand for the plant in various countries including Asia and Western Europe, Australians in southern NSW began to develop farms dedicated to its production.[6] However, through mismanagement, ineffective sales tactics, and the increasing prevalence of ""post-harvest browning syndrome"" the popularity of the plant decreased by over 40% in 2004.[6] The  browning syndrome was reported to infect up to 20% of all exported plants causing a drop in the average exported plant quality from a rating of 2.75 (classified as ideal quality and freshness) to 1.75 (acceptable quality).[15] The B. Myrtifolia market was dependent entirely on plant quality and appearance, and therefore as this began to decrease so did the profits generated by the industry.[6] In response to this Australian growers and exporters in 2004, congregated to form the Backhousia Group, an organisation determined to improve sales, through more efficient farming techniques and aggressive sales campaigns.[23] The development of this value chain alliance in 2004, helped restore the Backhousia botanical industry, to a profitable margin within a period of two years.[6] Furthermore, with the uses of the plant now expanded, its potential as an exported product for antibacterial, cooking or repellent purposes may grow.[citation needed] References Further reading External links","Backhousia myrtifolia is used extensively as an aromatic/spice, due to the unique properties of its natural oils; methyl eugenol and elemicin.

 Backhousia oligantha is a rare species of plant in the family Myrtaceae. Mostly found in south eastern Queensland. The small tree has an unusual growth habit, with colonies of many prostrate shoots and many stems from one genotype. At the type location, there are 100 to 200 stems in six clumps, possibly with only six unique individuals. The epithet oligantha is derived from the Greek language, meaning 'few flowers'.[1][2] References  This Myrtaceae article is a stub.

 Backhousia sciadophora is a common Australian tree, growing from near Dungog in New South Wales to near Kilcoy in southeast Queensland. Common names include shatterwood, ironwood, boomerang tree and Curracabark. The habitat of shatterwood is drier areas of rainforest in gorges and steep slopes, usually not on volcanic soils.
 Description Shatterwood is a small to medium size tree, occasionally reaching 30 metres in height and 80 cm in trunk diameter. The tree's crown appears dark and attractive.
 The trunk of Backhousia sciadophora is cylindrical, and often flanged or buttressed at the base. Shatterwood is so named because of the brittle nature of the timber.
 The bark is grey or fawn, rough with short fibres, finely vertically fissured, shedding in narrow scales. The bark structure appears to consist of numerous paper-like layers.
 The leaves are opposite, simple, entire, broadly ovate or elliptical, 5 to 10 cm long. They are round or drawn into a blunt point, or sometimes notched.  Oil dots are small and numerous. The leaf stalks are very short.
 Leaf venation includes a looping intermarginal vein, well removed from the leaf's edge. A second intermarginal leaf vein is present, closer to the leaf edge. The midrib vein is sunken on the lower surface, but slightly raised above.
 Flowers are white, small and numerous. The flowering period is in June and July. The fruit matures from May to August, being a brown capsule, bell-shaped, 5 mm in diameter including the five persistent calyx lobes, each 2 mm long. There are five to eight seeds in each fruit, which are oval, 1 mm long, and golden brown in colour.

 Backhousia subargentea (syn. Choricarpia subargentea) is a rare Australian rainforest tree,[2] growing near Mullumbimby in northeastern New South Wales and from Boonah to Imbil in southeastern Queensland.
 Common names include giant ironwood, ironwood box, scrub ironwood and lancewood.  The New South Wales habitat of Backhousia subargentea is dry rainforest thickets on hillsides near Mullumbimby. It grows in association with the shatterwood and wild quince.
 Description Backhousia subargentea is a small to medium tree, occasionally reaching 30 metres in height. However, it is much smaller in New South Wales, reaching only 8 m high and with a stem diameter of 20 cm. The trunk is often multi-stemmed and crooked, not cylindrical in cross-section, with some buttressing at the base.
 The trunk can be smooth and glossy, of an attractive orange-brown or pinkish mauve colour, or green where bark has recently been shed. At other times, the bark sheds irregularly resulting in a mottled trunk, similar to the spotted gum and the leopardwood.
 The leaves are opposite, simple and entire, lanceolate or broad with a fine leaf tip, around 4 to 8 cm long. The leaves are glossy dark green above, and greyish fawn below. Crushed leaves have a familiar eucalyptus scent. (Both plants being dry fruited myrtles). Oil dots are evident when viewed with a magnifying glass. The midrib and lateral leaf venation is only visible on the top surface. An intramarginal vein surrounds the leaf, about 2 mm from the edge. Leaf stalks are 5 to 10 mm long, with scaly matter on the stalk.
 Flowers are white, densely together in globular heads, 5 to 8 mm long, appearing in April. The fruit matures around six months later as a small dry capsule, 5 mm in diameter on a stalk 6 to 10 mm long.
 Uses If not so rare, it could possibly be used as an ornamental tree.

 Backhousia tetraptera is a tree in the family Myrtaceae. The only known population occurs at the foot of Mount Stuart near Townsville in Queensland, Australia.[3][4] The species grows to between 5 and 12 metres high often with multiple trunks that have a mottled flaking bark including grey, grey-brown and/or pink colouration. The leaves are simple and opposite and are 5.5 to 9 cm long and 1.5 to 3.8 cm wide.[3] The white flowers appear in clusters of 10 and have 56 to 65 stamens.
Flowering is induced by the first significant rainfall of the wet season, appearing four weeks later.[3] The distinctive fruits are capsules with four wings that appear in clusters and fade from pink to white and dry to brown.[3] The species was formally described in 2012.[2][5] As of September 2024[update] it was designated critically endangered under the EPBC Act.[1] References",NA,NA,NA,NA References,NA,NA,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backhousia_tetraptera,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

 Schidiomyrtus diosmifolia (Rudge) Schauer
 Baeckea diosmifolia, commonly known as fringed baeckea,[2] is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae and is endemic to eastern Australia. It is a shrub with lance-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, and white flowers with seven to nine stamens.
 Description Baeckea diosmifolia is a shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 60 cm (24 in). Its leaves are lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, 2.1–4.5 mm (0.083–0.177 in) long, 0.5–1.5 mm (0.020–0.059 in) wide on a petiole about 0.2 mm (0.0079 in) long. The flowers are up to 5.5 mm (0.22 in) wide and more or less sessile with linear to lance-shaped bracteoles 1.2–2.8 mm (0.047–0.110 in) long, but that fall off as the flower opens. The five sepals are 0.5–1.0 mm (0.020–0.039 in) long, the five petals are white, more or less round and 1.2–2.8 mm (0.047–0.110 in) long, there are seven to nine stamens and the style is about 1.0 mm (0.039 in) long. Flowering mainly occurs from December to May and the fruit is about 2 mm (0.079 in) in diameter.[2][3][4] Taxonomy Baeckea diosmifolia was first formally described in 1807 by Edward Rudge in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London.[5][6] The specific epithet (diosmifolia) means ""Diosma-leaved"".[7] Distribution and habitat This baeckea grows in wet heathland along the coast and nearby tablelands of New South Wales as far south as the Budawang Range and as far inland as the Goulburn River. It is only known from a single population near Crows Nest in Queensland, although there are old records from Brisbane suburbs.[2][3][7] References","Baeckea diosmifolia is a shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 60 cm (24 in).

 Balaustion grande is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with oblong or narrowly oblong leaves and usually white or pale pink flowers with 16 to 28 stamens fused in a ring.
 Description Balaustion grande is a low-growing shrub that typically grows to 40–50 cm (16–20 in) high and 20–100 cm (7.9–39.4 in) wide. Its leaves are oblong or narrowly oblong, often clustered, mostly 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) long and 0.5–1 mm (0.020–0.039 in) wide and sessile or on a petiole up to 0.3 mm (0.012 in) long. The flowers are 8–13 mm (0.31–0.51 in) in diameter and borne in up to 6 pairs, each flower on a pedicel 6–8.5 mm (0.24–0.33 in) long. The floral tube is 1.0–1.5 mm (0.039–0.059 in) long and 1.75–3.5 mm (0.069–0.138 in) wide and the sepals are egg-shaped and deep maroon, 1.3–3 mm (0.051–0.118 in) long and 2.3–3.5 mm (0.091–0.138 in) wide. The petals are usually white or pale pink, rarely pink, and 2.5–6 mm (0.098–0.236 in) long with 16 to 28 stamens fused in a ring. Flowering has been recorded from July to October, and the fruit is a capsule 1.0–1.4 mm (0.039–0.055 in) long and 0.55–0.65 mm (0.022–0.026 in) wide.[2][3] This species is distinguished from other species of Balaustion by it stamens that are fused at their bases, and from its pedicels that are much longer than its peduncles.
 Taxonomy This species was first formally described in 1904 by the Ernst Georg Pritzel who gave it the name Baeckea grandis in Engler's journal Botanische Jahrbücher für Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie in an article by Pritzel and Ludwig Diels entitled Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae occidentalis.[4][5] In 2022, Barbara Lynette Rye transferred the species to Balaustion as B. grande in the journal Nuytsia.[2][6] The specific epithet (grande) is from the Latin grandis meaning 'great, large or tall'.[2][7] Distribution and habitat Balaustion grande grows on sand-plains between Bookara near the Greenough River to Wongan Hills in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains and Swan Coastal Plain bioregions of south-western Western Australia.[2][3] Conservation status This species of Balaustion is listed as ""Priority Three"" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions[3] meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.[8] References","Balaustion grande is a low-growing shrub that typically grows to 40–50 cm (16–20 in) high and 20–100 cm (7.9–39.4 in) wide.

 Baeckea gunniana, commonly known as alpine baeckea,[3] is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae and is endemic to alpine and sub-alpine areas of south-eastern Australia. It is a densely-branched shrub with egg-shaped to oblong leaves and small white flowers with four to six stamens.
 Description Baeckea gunniana is a smooth, compact shrub growing up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) high, although it can reach up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) at lower altitudes. It is sometimes prostrate, spreading over rocks and boulders. The branchlets have papery or fibrous brown bark. The leaves are crowded, elliptical to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, 1.9–3.8 mm (0.075–0.150 in) long, 0.9–1.4 mm (0.035–0.055 in) wide on a petiole about 0.5 mm (0.020 in) long and have smooth edges. The flowers up to 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter and are borne singly in upper leaf axils, each flower on a pedicel 0.4–1 mm (0.016–0.039 in) long. The sepals are triangular to oblong, 0.6–0.8 mm (0.024–0.031 in) long and the petals are white, more or less round and 1.5–1.8 mm (0.059–0.071 in) long. There are four to six stamens all about the same length. The ovary has a single locule, the style is needle-shaped and in a small dent in the top of the ovary. (The unilocular ovary is unique in the genus.) The fruit is a cup-like capsule, the seeds small and angular, remaining inconspicuous on the ground upon release.[3][4][5][6][7] Taxonomy and phylogeny Baeckea gunniana was first formally described in 1843 by the German botanist Johannes Conrad Schauer in Walpers' book Repertorium Botanices Systematicae.[8][9] The specific epithet (gunniana) honours Ronald Campbell Gunn.[5] Distribution and habitat Alpine baeckea is restricted to alpine or subalpine regions, from Mount Ginini in the Australian Capital Territory and Mount Kosciuszko in south-eastern New South Wales to eastern Victoria and south-western Tasmania. Baeckea gunniana is most prevalent at high altitudes between 1,000 to 1,400 m (3,300 to 4,600 ft) , however, it has been observed to grow above 2,000 m (6,600 ft) near Mount Kosciuszko, and as low as 450 m (1,480 ft) in western Tasmania.[5][6] Baeckea gunniana is commonly found growing with species such as Callistemon pityoides, Epacris paludosa, and Empodisma minus, in heathlands or boggy sedgeland. It is also common near creeks, and sometimes in shaded areas under Eucalyptus species.[5][6] Ecology This species forms an integral part of the broad-toothed mouse habitat in New South Wales, providing protection from predators and large grazers.[10] Uses The seed coat/covering or testa of some Baeckea species has been recorded to form a physical barrier inhibiting seed germination.[5] This may be reverted by removing or nicking the testa using a needle or scalpel, improving the rate of germination.[5]B. gunniana can also be vegetatively propagated from cuttings of semi-hardened new growth.
 Baeckea leaves are edible and often used as a tea substitute because of their aromatic citrus-like flavour.[4][10] Extracts from B. gunniana have been found to inhibit the activity of DNA Polymerase enzyme.[11] References","Baeckea gunniana is a smooth, compact shrub growing up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) high, although it can reach up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) at lower altitudes.

The flowers are up to 5 mm (0.20 in) wide and arranged singly in leaf axils, each flower on a pedicel 1.5–2.0 mm (0.059–0.079 in) long with two linear bracteoles at the base, but that fall off as the flower opens. The sepal lobes are triangular and the petals are egg-shaped, white and 1.5–2.5 mm (0.059–0.098 in) long. There are eight to fifteen stamens with curved filaments, none of which is opposite the petals. The flat-topped ovary has two cells. Flowering occurs in most months, especially in spring and summer, and the fruit is a cup-like capsule about 2 mm (0.079 in) in diameter, containing angular seeds.[2][3][4][5][6] Taxonomy and naming Baeckea linifolia was first formally described in 1807 by Edward Rudge in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London from a specimen collected ""near Port Jackson"".[7][8] The specific epithet (linifolia) is derived from the Latin words linum  (""flax"") and folium (""leaf""),[9] giving a compound Latin adjective which describes the plant as having leaves like those of flax.[10] Distribution and habitat Swamp baeckea grows in heath in damp places, often near waterfalls and gullies and is found along the coast and adjacent ranges from south-east Queensland through New South Wales to the Cann River in north-eastern Victoria where it is rare.[3][5] Victorian plants typically have smaller, more rigid leaves in comparison with plants found in New South Wales and Queensland, and were previously included in Baeckea linifolia var. brevifolia F.Muell. ex Benth.[5] Use in horticulture This baeckea is reasonably well known in gardens and is a hardy plant in well-drained soil in a sunny or part-shaped situation.

 Melaleuca aestiva  (K.J.Brooks) Craven & R.D.Edwards 
 Beaufortia aestiva, commonly known as Kalbarri beaufortia,[2] or summer flame,[3] is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It is a dense, usually rounded shrub with small leaves and which bears yellow or red flowers in bottlebrush-like spikes near the ends of the branches in summer. It is similar to Beaufortia squarrosa but that is a smaller shrub which always has red flowers.
 Description Beaufortia aestiva is sometimes a dense, rounded shrub and others an open spreading one. It occasionally grows to a height of 4 m (10 ft) but more usually 2 m (7 ft) and 2 m (7 ft) wide. The leaves are egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, 4–11 mm (0.2–0.4 in) long and are arranged in alternating pairs (decussate), so that they form four rows along the stems.[4] The flowers are creamy orange-coloured to red and are arranged in heads 35–45 mm (1–2 in) in diameter, on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. Flowering occurs from June to December, sometimes later and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules 7–9 millimetres (0.3–0.4 in) long. It can be distinguished from other beaufortias by its stamens which are in bundles of 5 to 7, 28–40 mm (1–2 in) long, joined for about half their length.[2][4][5] Taxonomy and naming Beaufortia aestiva was first formally described in 1998 by Kristine J. Brooks in Nuytsia from a specimen found near Binnu.[6] The specific epithet (""aestiva"") is a Latin word meaning ""summer"".[7] Distribution and habitat Beaufortia aestiva mainly occurs between Kalbarri and Eneabba[5] in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Yalgoo bioregions of south-western Western Australia.[2] It grows in deep sand on sandplains[8] in kwongan.[5] Conservation Beaufortia aestiva is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.[2] References","Beaufortia aestiva is sometimes a dense, rounded shrub and others an open spreading one.

 Melaleuca anisandra (Schauer) Craven & R.D.Edwards 
 Beaufortia anisandra, commonly known as dark beaufortia,[2] is a plant in the myrtle family Myrtaceae, and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It is a densely branched shrub with egg-shaped, upward pointing leaves and which bears heads of dark bluish-purple to red flowers with stamen bundles of different lengths. It is reported to have an unpleasant odour.
 Description Beaufortia anisandra is a densely branched shrub which grows to a height of 1.5 m (5 ft). The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs and are egg-shaped to lance-shaped, 3–6.5 mm (0.1–0.3 in) long, rigid, concave in cross section with a midvein and several faint lateral veins.[2][3][4] The flowers are red to dark purplish red and are arranged in roughly spherical heads on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering. The flowers have 5 sepals, 5 petals and 5 bundles of stamens. The stamens are joined for most of their length, with about 3 separate filaments extending beyond the joined part. Some bundles are more than 19 mm (0.7 in) long while others in the same flower are much shorter. The variation is stamen length in the individual flowers is a distinguishing feature of this beaufortia. Flowering occurs from January to July or from October to December and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, 8–15 mm (0.3–0.6 in) long, 7–12 mm (0.3–0.5 in) wide and more or less clustered.[2][4][3] Its occurrence at Cape Riche was noted in 1854 by William Henry Harvey (""Dr. Harvey"") who wrote: ""It always reminds me of Sir Francis B., because I remember your telling me that he likes a plant to have a bad smell rather than none at all; and this namesake of his would surely please him, for it has an awful stench.""[5] Taxonomy and naming Beaufortia anisandra was first formally described in 1843 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Dissertatio phytographica de Regelia, Beaufortia et Calothamno.[6] The specific epithet (anisandra) means ""unequal male"", referring to the length of the stamens.[7] Distribution and habitat Beaufortia anisandra mainly occurs near Albany and Esperance in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains and Jarrah Forest bioregions of south-western Western Australia.[2] It grows in sand and rocky quartzite soils on hills, rocky outcrops and plains.[8] Conservation Beaufortia anisandra is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.[2] References","Beaufortia anisandra is a densely branched shrub which grows to a height of 1.5 m (5 ft).

 Beaufortia cyrtodonta, commonly known as Stirling Range bottlebrush,[2] is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It is a compact shrub with crowded leaves which appear greyish due to their covering of fine, soft hairs. It has heads of red flowers in spring and occurs in the Stirling Range district.
 Description Beaufortia cyrtodonta is a compact shrub which grows to a height of 1.5 metres (5 ft). The leaves are linear, crowded and arranged in alternate pairs (decussate) so that they make four rows along the stems. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped, 4–7 millimetres (0.2–0.3 in) long and often have a covering of fine hairs, giving them a greyish appearance.[3][2][4][5] The flowers are red and are arranged in heads about 2.5 millimetres (0.1 in) in diameter on the ends of branches. The flowers have 5 sepals, 5 petals and 5 bundles of stamens. The bundles contain 3 stamens and are joined for 8.5–13.5 millimetres (0.3–0.5 in) with the free stamen ends a further 1.5–3 millimetres (0.06–0.1 in) long. Flowering occurs from June to November and is followed by fruits which are woody capsules 7–13 millimetres (0.3–0.5 in) long and clustered together.[3][2][4] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca cyrtodonta was first formally described in 1867 by Nikolai Turczaninow in Bulletin de la Société Impériale des Naturalistes de Moscou.[6][7] In 1867, George Bentham transferred it to Beaufortia as Beaufortia cyrtodonta.[5][8] The specific epithet (""cyrtodonta"") is from the Ancient Greek kyrtos meaning ""curved"" or ""bent""[9]: 139  and odous meaning ""tooth"".[9]: 807  Distribution and habitat Beaufortia cyrtodonta mainly occurs in the Stirling Range district in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee bioregions of south-western Western Australia.[2] It grows in sandy and gravelly soils often derived from laterite on hills and outcrops.[3][4][10] Conservation Beaufortia cyrtodonta is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.[2] References","Beaufortia cyrtodonta is a compact shrub which grows to a height of 1.5 metres (5 ft).

 Beaufortia decussata, commonly known as gravel bottlebrush,[2] is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It has long stems branching only near the upper ends, and scarlet to orange-red flowers in a bottlebrush shape beneath the branches.
 Description Beaufortia decussata is an erect, open shrub with few branches growing to a height of 3 m (10 ft). The leaves are arranged in alternating pairs (decussate) so that they make four rows along the stems. They are egg-shaped, pointed at the end, about 10 mm (0.4 in) long and usually have 5 veins visible.[2][3][4][5] The flowers are red to orange red and are arranged in heads about 40 mm (2 in) in diameter and 100 mm (4 in) long, forming a cylinder around the long stems under their branches. There are 5 sepals, 5 small petals and 5 bundles of stamens which give the flowers their colour and are much longer than the inconspicuous petals. Flowering occurs either from August to December or from January to April and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules. It was described in John Sims's Edwards Botanical Register as ""a very splendid shrub"".[3][5][6] Taxonomy and naming Beaufortia decussata was the first species of Beaufortia to be described. It was formally described in 1812 by Robert Brown in William Townsend Aiton's Hortus Kewensis.[7][8] The specific epithet is from the Latin decussatus meaning ""form crosswise like the letter X, the Roman numeral ten"".[9] Distribution and habitat Beaufortia decussata occurs in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Warren bioregions in the southwest of Western Australia,[6] where it grows in tall shrubland[5] in soils derived from laterite.[10] Conservation Beaufortia decussata is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.[6] References","Beaufortia decussata is an erect, open shrub with few branches growing to a height of 3 m (10 ft).

 Beaufortia empetrifolia, commonly known as south coast beaufortia,[2] is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It is a highly branched shrub with small, crowded leaves and pinkish to purple flowers in small, bottlebrush-like spikes in the warmer months. It is similar to Beaufortia micrantha except that its leaves are slightly larger.
 Description Beaufortia empetrifolia is a compact, much branched shrub which grows to a height of 2 m (7 ft). The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs (decussate) so they make four rows along the stems. The leaves are egg-shaped, 1.5–3 mm (0.06–0.1 in) long and 0.5–2 mm (0.02–0.08 in) wide.[2][3][4][5] The flowers are pink to purplish red and are arranged in heads about 20 mm (0.8 in) in diameter, on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering.

The stamens bundles are hairy and joined for 1.5–5 mm (0.06–0.2 in) of their length with the free parts a further 2.5–5 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long. Flowering can occur in almost any month, depending on the weather and is followed by fruits which are woody capsules. The capsules are 6.5–11.5 mm (0.3–0.5 in) long and 5–6 mm (0.20–0.24 in) wide and often joined together.[2][3] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca empetrifolia was first formally described in 1828 by the German botanist, Ludwig Reichenbach in Iconographia Botanica Exotica.[6] In 1843, Johannes Schauer recognised it as Beaufortia empetrifolia.[7]Lyndley Craven proposes combining Beaufortia and several other related genera with Melaleuca,[8] in which case, Reichenbach's original name would be restored.

 Beaufortia incana, commonly known as grey-leaved beaufortia,[2] is a plant in the myrtle family Myrtaceae, and is endemic to southwest of Western Australia. It is a shrub with crowded leaves that appear whitish due to their covering of fine, soft hairs on both surfaces. It has almost spherical heads of red flowers in spring.
 Description Beaufortia incana is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 0.5–2 m (1 ft 8 in – 6 ft 7 in). The leaves are arranged alternately, crowded on the younger stems, linear to lance-shaped and arranged in alternate pairs (decussate) so that they make four rows along the stems. The leaves are 5–12 mm (0.20–0.47 in) long and have a covering of fine hairs on both surfaces.[2][3][4] The flowers are red, arranged in dense heads about 25 mm (0.98 in) in diameter on the ends of the branches and are surrounded by long soft hairs. The flowers have 5 sepals, 5 petals and 5 bundles of stamens. The stamens give the flowers their colour and are in bundles of 3, joined for most of their length, the bundles of different lengths. Flowering occurs from August to December and is followed by fruit that are woody capsules.[2][3][4] Taxonomy and naming Beaufortia macrostemon var. incana was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham in Flora Australiensis.[3][5] In 1972, Alex George raised it to species status in Nuytsia.[6][7] The specific epithet (""incana"") is a Latin word meaning ""quite gray"".[8] Distribution and habitat Beaufortia incana grows in kwongan and shrubland in the Avon Wheatbelt, Jarrah Forest, Mallee and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions of south-western Western Australia. It grows in soils derived from laterite on hills and sandplains.[2][4][9] Conservation Beaufortia incana is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[2] References","Beaufortia incana is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 0.5–2 m (1 ft 8 in – 6 ft 7 in).

 Melaleuca orbifolia  (Muell.) Craven & R.D.Edwards 
 Beaufortia orbifolia, commonly known as Ravensthorpe bottlebrush,[2] is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It is an erect or spreading shrub with round, dished leaves crowded on the younger stems, and bright red flower spikes. It is found in laterite hills near Ravensthorpe. It is distinguished from other beaufortias by having green stamen bundles with the free ends red.
 Description Beaufortia orbifolia is an erect, sometimes open, spreading shrub which grows to a height of about 3 m (10 ft). The leaves are arranged in alternate pairs (decussate), so that, especially on the younger branches, they make four rows along the stems. The leaves are flat or slightly dished, broad egg-shaped to round, 4.5–6 mm (0.18–0.24 in) long and have 5 or 7 veins.[2][3][4][5][6] The flowers are red and green and are arranged in bottlebrush-like spikes about 40 mm (2 in) in diameter and 60 mm (2 in) long on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The flowers have 5 sepals, 5 petals and 5 bundles of stamens. The stamen bundles contain 3 to 7 stamens, are green in their lower half and red in the upper and joined for about half of their length. Flowering occurs from August to January and is followed by fruits which are woody capsules in roughly spherical or cylindrical clusters.[2][4][5][6] Taxonomy and naming Beaufortia orbifolia was first formally described in 1862 by Victorian government botanist, Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from a specimen collected on the slopes of East Mount Barren by George Maxwell.[7] The specific epithet (orbifolia) is derived from the Latin orbis meaning ""a circle""[8]: 205  and folium meaning ""a leaf"".[8]: 466  Distribution and habitat Beaufortia orbifolia mainly occurs near Ravensthorpe in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions.[2] It usually grows in soils derived from laterite or granite on stony plains.[9] Conservation Beaufortia orbifolia is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.[2] References","Beaufortia orbifolia is an erect, sometimes open, spreading shrub which grows to a height of about 3 m (10 ft).

 Beaufortia purpurea, commonly known as purple beaufortia,[2] is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It is an erect or spreading shrub with linear to egg-shaped leaves and purplish-red flowers in dense heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering.
 Description Beaufortia purpurea is an erect, sometimes open, spreading shrub with long, straight, thin branches and which grows to a height of about 1.5 m (5 ft). The leaves are arranged in alternate pairs (decussate) on the younger branches, so that they make four rows along the stems. The leaves are lance-shaped to egg-shaped while the oldest ones are linear. The leaves are 4–8.5 mm (0.16–0.33 in) long and have 3 or 5 veins.[2][3][4] The flowers are purple or purplish red and are arranged in bottlebrush-like spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The flowering part of the stem is densely hairy and the flowers have 5 sepals, 5 petals and 5 bundles of stamens. The stamen bundles, which give the flowers their colour contain 3 to 7 (usually 5) stamens which are joined for about half their length. Flowering occurs from October to December or in January to February and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules in clusters about 12 mm (0.47 in) long .[2][3][4] Taxonomy and naming Beaufortia purpurea was first formally described in 1839 by English botanist, John Lindley in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony.[5][6] The specific epithet (purpurea) is a Latin word meaning ""purple"".[7] Distribution and habitat Beaufortia purpurea mainly occurs in the outer suburbs of Perth in the Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions.[2] It usually grows in soils derived from laterite or granite on rocky slopes.[8] Conservation Beaufortia orbifolia is classified as ""Priority Three"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions[2] meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.[9] References","Beaufortia purpurea is an erect, sometimes open, spreading shrub with long, straight, thin branches and which grows to a height of about 1.5 m (5 ft).

 Beaufortia raggedensis, commonly known as Mount Ragged beaufortia,[2] is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It is a compact shrub with densely clustered leaves and large heads of deep red flowers in spring and only occurs near Mount Arid in the Cape Arid National Park.
 Description Beaufortia raggedensis is usually a compact shrub, sometimes openly branched, which grows to a height of 1.5 metres (5 ft). The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs and are linear in shape, 5–10 millimetres (0.2–0.4 in) long, less than 1 millimetre (0.04 in) wide and are often in dense clusters. They often have a covering of fine hairs, giving them a greyish appearance.[2][3][4][5] The flowers are deep red and are arranged in heads on the ends of branches. The flowers have 5 sepals, 5 petals and 5 bundles of stamens. The bundles contain between 5 and 7 stamens and are joined for 5–10 millimetres (0.2–0.4 in) with the free stamens branching at different points. Flowering occurs from September to December and is followed by fruits which are woody capsules 15–20 millimetres (0.6–0.8 in) long, 10 millimetres (0.4 in) wide and joined together.[2][3][4] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca raggedensis was first formally described in 2016 by Andrew A. Burbidge and the description was published in Nuytsia.[6] The specific epithet (""raggedensis"") refers to the Mount Ragged, near which this species is found.[3] Distribution and habitat Beaufortia raggedensis grows in quartzite, only on the slopes and bases of mountains of the Russell Range in the Cape Arid National Park, Mallee bioregion.

 Beaufortia sparsa, commonly known as swamp bottlebrush,[2] is a plant in the myrtle family Myrtaceae, and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia.  It is an erect or spreading shrub with round, dished leaves crowded on the younger stems, and bright red flower spikes in the warmer months.
 Description Beaufortia sparsa is an evergreen shrub that grows to 1–3 metres (3–10 ft) tall and 1–2.5 metres (3–8 ft) wide. The leaves are bright green, oval-shaped, flat or slightly dished, 6–12 millimetres (0.2–0.5 in) long and have many veins.[2][3][4] The flowers are bright orange to red in colour and arranged in bottlebrush-like spikes near the ends of the branches that continue to grow after flowering. The flowers have 5 sepals, 5 petals and 5 bundles of stamens each containing about 5 stamens. The hypanthium is about 2 millimetres (0.08 in) long but the stamens, which give the flowers their colour, are up to 26 millimetres (1 in) long. Flowers are produced from January to April and from September to November and are followed by fruits which are woody capsules which are retained on the stems indefinitely.[2][3][4] Taxonomy and naming Beaufortia sparsa was first formally described in 1812 by Scottish botanist, Robert Brown in William Aiton's Hortus Kewensis.[5][6] The specific epithet (""sparsa"") is a Latin word meaning ""scattered"", referring to the species being scattered in swamps.[7] Distribution and habitat Beaufortia sparsa mainly occurs between Busselton and Albany in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren bioregions of south-western Western Australia.[2] It usually grows in sand in swampy places or near watercourses.[8] Conservation Beaufortia orbifolia is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.[2] Use in horticulture Swamp bottlebrush is probably the most widely cultivated in the genus Beaufortia but it is not well known in gardens.

 Beaufortia sprengelioides is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It is a rigid, spreading shrub with crowded, round leaves and small, roughly spherical heads of pale pink flowers on the ends of its branches. It was one of the first Australian plant species collected by Europeans and has had several name changes since then.
 Description Beaufortia sprengelioides is a rigid, spreading shrub which grows to a height of about 2 metres (7 ft). The leaves are crowded and mostly arranged in alternate pairs (decussate), so that, especially on the younger branches, they make four rows along the stems. The leaves are flat or slightly dished, broadly egg-shaped to round, 2–3 millimetres (0.08–0.1 in) long and have 3 veins, not including the marginal veins.[2][3] The flowers are pale pink to white and arranged in spherical heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The flowers have 5 sepals, 5 petals and 5 bundles of stamens. The stamen bundles, which give the flowers their colour, contain 9 to 15 stamens and are joined for more than half their length. Flowering occurs from July to November and is followed by fruits which are woody capsules.[2][3] Taxonomy and naming Beaufortia sprengelioides was collected before 1670 by the English explorer, William Dampier.[4][5] It was first formally described in 1828 by the Swiss botanist, Augustin de Candolle in Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis and given the name Melaleuca sprengelioides.[6][7]Schauer then included de Candolle's plant in Regelia ciliata, apparently on the basis of de Candolle's drawings.[8][9] In 1999, Lyndley Craven reinterpreted Schauer's work and gave the plant the name Beaufortia sprengelioides.[9] The specific epithet (""sprengelioides"") is a reference to the genus Sprengelia in the family Ericaceae.

 Melaleuca pulcherrima Craven & R.D.Edwards
 Beaufortia squarrosa, commonly known as sand bottlebrush,[2] is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. The Noongar peoples know the plant as buno.[3]
It is sometimes a dense shrub, others straggling with 4 neat rows of small, oval leaves along the stems, and heads of red, orange or yellow flowers in the warmer months.
 Description Beaufortia squarrosa is a shrub which grows to a height of about 2 metres (7 ft). The leaves are crowded and arranged in alternating pairs (decussate) so that they make four rows along the stems. The leaves are egg-shaped to oval, less than 4.5 millimetres (0.2 in) long and have 5 or 7 veins.[2][4][5][6] The flowers are usually bright red but sometimes orange or yellow and are arranged in roughly spherical heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The flowers have 5 sepals, 5 petals and 5 bundles of stamens. The stamen bundles, which give the flower its colour, contain 3 to 7 stamens and are joined for more than half their length. Flowering occurs from July to December or from January to May and is followed by fruits which are woody capsules.[2][4][5] Taxonomy and naming Beaufortia squarrosa was first formally described in 1843 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Dissertatio phytographica de Regelia, Beaufortia et Calothamno.[7] The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word squarrosus, meaning ""rough with stiff scales, bracts, leaves or processes"".[8] Distribution and habitat Beaufortia squarrosa mainly occurs on the coastal plain between the Busselton and Eneabba districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions.[2] It usually grows in sand plains and depressions that are wet in winter.[9] Conservation Beaufortia squarrosa is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.[2] References","Beaufortia squarrosa is a shrub which grows to a height of about 2 metres (7 ft).

The flowers have 5 sepals, 5 petals and 5 bundles of stamens. The stamen bundles, which give the flower its colour, contain 3 to 7 stamens and are joined for more than half their length. Flowering occurs from July to December or from January to May and is followed by fruits which are woody capsules.[2][4][5] Taxonomy and naming Beaufortia squarrosa was first formally described in 1843 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Dissertatio phytographica de Regelia, Beaufortia et Calothamno.[7] The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word squarrosus, meaning ""rough with stiff scales, bracts, leaves or processes"".[8] Distribution and habitat Beaufortia squarrosa mainly occurs on the coastal plain between the Busselton and Eneabba districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions.[2] It usually grows in sand plains and depressions that are wet in winter.[9] Conservation Beaufortia squarrosa is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.[2] References","Beaufortia squarrosa was first formally described in 1843 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Dissertatio phytographica de Regelia, Beaufortia et Calothamno.[7] The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word squarrosus, meaning ""rough with stiff scales, bracts, leaves or processes"".[8] Distribution and habitat Beaufortia squarrosa mainly occurs on the coastal plain between the Busselton and Eneabba districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions.[2] It usually grows in sand plains and depressions that are wet in winter.[9] Conservation Beaufortia squarrosa is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.[2] References","Beaufortia squarrosa mainly occurs on the coastal plain between the Busselton and Eneabba districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions.[2] It usually grows in sand plains and depressions that are wet in winter.[9] Conservation Beaufortia squarrosa is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.[2] References",NA References,NA,NA,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufortia_squarrosa,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Beaufortia squarrosa is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.[2] References"

 Callistemon acuminatus Cheel
 Melaleuca flammea, commonly known as tapering-leaved bottlebrush,[2]  is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. (The Australian Plant Census and some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon acuminatus.) It is a shrub with broad, lance-shaped leaves which have wavy edges and taper gradually to a fine point. In spring it has typical bottlebrush flowers whose fiery colour gives the species its name.
 Description Melaleuca flammea is a shrub growing to 1–5 m (3–20 ft) tall with hard, fibrous bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 36–151 mm (1–6 in) long, 6–31 mm (0.2–1 in) wide, broad to narrow lance-shaped and gradually taper to a fine point. They are also distinguished by their broad v-shape, wavy margin with scattered fine teeth and 12 to 33 distinct lateral veins.[3][2][4] The flowers are deep red to crimson and arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The spikes are up to 70 mm (3 in) in diameter with 25 to 120 individual flowers. The petals are 3–5.4 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long and fall off as the flower ages. There are 20 to 32 bright red stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs mainly in spring but often at other times of the year and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, 3.9–5.5 mm (0.15–0.22 in) long.[3][2] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca flammea was first named in 2006 by Lyndley Craven in Novon.[5][6] It had first been formally described as Callistemon acuminatus by Edwin Cheel in 1911 in Illustrations of New South Wales Plants from a specimen collected ""on slopes of rocky mountains, Crawford River, 7 miles (10km) from Bullahdelah.""[7] The specific epithet (flammea) is from the Latin flammeus meaning “fiery” or ""fiery-red"", referring to the fiery colour of the stamens.[3] The Australian Plant Census accepts the name Callistemon acuminatus but it is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca flammea by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.[8][9] Distribution and habitat Melaleuca flammea occurs near Nambour in Queensland and in coastal areas of New South Wales from Port Stephens to the Clarence River district. It usually grows in woodland or forest on dry, rocky hilltops[3][2] Conservation status Melaleuca flammea, as Callistemon acuminatus, is a classified in New South Wales as a ""Rare or Threatened Australian Plant"".[4] Use in horticulture Although not common in cultivation, this species is hardy, frost and drought tolerant and its distinctive leaves and large, brightly coloured flowers give it horticultural potential.[4] References","Melaleuca flammea is a shrub growing to 1–5 m (3–20 ft) tall with hard, fibrous bark.

 Melaleuca brachyandra, commonly known as prickly bottlebrush or scarlet bottlebrush, is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to  New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in Australia. (Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon brachyandrus.)[2] It is a shrub or small tree with narrow leaves and showy red and green flowers making it an ideal ornamental plant in temperate areas.
 Description Melaleuca brachyandra is a shrub growing to 1.5–8 m (5–30 ft) tall with hard bark and a rigid habit. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 18–61 mm (0.7–2 in) long, 0.5–1.7 mm (0.02–0.07 in) wide, linear in shape, kidney-shaped in cross section and with the end tapering to a sharp point.[3][4] The flowers are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering. The spikes are up to 35 mm (1 in) in diameter with 7 to 36 individual flowers. The petals are 2.8–4.9 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long and fall off as the flower ages. There are 50 to 84 stamens in each flower, with their ""stalks"" (the filaments) rich crimson and ""tips"" (the anthers) green. Flowering occurs from September to January and is followed by fruits that are woody capsules, 9–12.4 mm (0.4–0.5 in) long.[3][4] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca brachyandra was first formally described in 2006 by Lyndley Craven in Novon.[5][6] It had previously been known as Callistemon brachyandrus since John Lindley described it in 1849 in Journal of the Horticultural Society of London.[7][8] The specific epithet (brachyandra) is derived from the ancient Greek words brachys (βραχύς), meaning ""short"" and anēr, genitive andros (ἀνήρ, genitive ἀνδρός), meaning ""male"",[9] referring to the length of the stamens being shorter than the styles.[3] Callistemon brachyandrus is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca brachyandra by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.[10] Distribution and habitat Melaleuca brachyandra occurs in scattered inland areas of New South Wales, mostly commonly in the Cobar district.[4] It also occurs in the lower Murray River districts of north-western Victoria and south-eastern South Australia.
 Use in horticulture Although it has prickly leaves, the attractive flower spikes of M. brachyandra make it a suitable ornamental for temperate gardens.[3] It is usually more resistant to pests than other species of the former Callistemon.[11] It prefers well-drained soil in a sunny situation.[12] References","Melaleuca brachyandra is a shrub growing to 1.5–8 m (5–30 ft) tall with hard bark and a rigid habit.

 Melaleuca citrina, the common red bottlebrush, crimson bottlebrush, or lemon bottlebrush,[3] is a plant in the myrtle family Myrtaceae, and is endemic to eastern Australia. Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon citrinus.[4] It is a hardy and adaptable species, common in its natural habitat. It is widely cultivated, not only in Australia. It was one of the first Australian plants to be grown outside the country, having been taken to England in 1770 by Joseph Banks. Its showy red flower spikes, present over most of the year in an ideal situation, account for its popularity.
 Description Melaleuca citrina is a shrub that lives for approximately ten years[5] and grows to 5 m (20 ft) tall but more usually in the range 1–3 m (3–10 ft) high and wide. It has hard, fibrous or papery bark and its young growth is usually covered with soft, silky hairs. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 26–99 mm (1–4 in) long, 4–25 mm (0.2–1 in) wide, hard, flat, narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end near the base and with a pointed but not sharp end. There are between 7 and 26 branching veins clearly visible on both sides of the leaves and a large number of distinct oil glands visible on both surfaces of the leaves.[2][6] The flowers are red and arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering and sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. The spikes are up to 45–70 mm (2–3 in) in diameter and 60–100 mm (2–4 in) long with up to 80 individual flowers. The petals are 3.9–5.8 mm (0.15–0.23 in) long and fall off as the flower ages. There are 30 to 45 stamens in each flower, with their ""stalks"" (the filaments) red and ""tips"" (the anthers) purple. Flowering occurs in most months of the year but mainly in November and December. Flowering is followed by fruit that are woody, cup-shaped capsules, 4.4–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long and about 7 mm (0.3 in) wide in cylindrical clusters along the stem. The fruiting capsules remain unopened until the plant, or the part bearing them dies.[2][6] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca citrina was first formally described in 1802 by the French botanist Georges Louis Marie Dumont de Courset in Le Botaniste Cultivateur.[7] The species had previously been known as Metrosideros citrina, in turn named by William Curtis in the Botanical Magazine in 1794, based on a flowering plant growing at Lord Cremorne's estate. That plant had grown from a root collected in 1770 at Botany Bay by Joseph Banks during the first voyage of James Cook to Australia. Curtis noted that the leaves ""when bruised give forth an agreeable fragrance.""[8][9] The specific epithet (citrina) alludes to the similarity of the aromatic property of leaves of this species and those of citrus plants.[2] Callistemon citrinus is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca citrina by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.[10]Callistemon lanceolatus is an older name.[11] Distribution and habitat Melaleuca citrina occurs in near coastal areas of New South Wales, including the Blue Mountains and extends as far west as the Central Western Slopes.[6] It also occurs in the east coast areas of Victoria[2] and grows in swamps and along creeks and rivers.[6] Ecology Birds have been observed using the species as a source of food. Those seeking nectar from the flowers include eastern spinebills, New Holland honeyeaters, noisy miners, red wattlebirds and silvereyes, while crimson rosellas eat the seeds.[12] Uses The herbicide Mesotrione was developed as a synthetic analogue of leptospermone, a natural herbicide produced by the roots of Callistemon citrinus.[13] Usefully, the plant blooms extendedly for most of the year, from March to October.[14] M. citrina, as Callistemon citrinus  had become established in cultivation in England by 1794 when flowering plants that were more than five years old had been observed at both Kew Gardens and Syon House and younger plants had become available in nurseries.[8] It is widely cultivated, often as Callistemon citrinus and sometimes as Callistemon lanceolatus. It is easily propagated from seed or cuttings and grows in most soils, preferring a sunny location. It is frost hardy and responds well to watering and the application of fertiliser but is tolerant of drought and frost.[3][11][15] A number of cultivars have been developed (as cultivars of Callistemon citrinus) including:[16] Gallery References","Melaleuca citrina is a shrub that lives for approximately ten years[5] and grows to 5 m (20 ft) tall but more usually in the range 1–3 m (3–10 ft) high and wide.

 Callistemon comboynensis  Cheel
 Melaleuca comboynensis, commonly known as cliff bottlebrush, is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. (Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon comboynensis.)[2] It is usually a shrub, similar to Melaleuca citrina with its hard leaves, spikes of red flowers and clusters of cup-shaped fruits but differs in that its leaves are generally wider and its habitat is usually rocky outcrops rather than along watercourses. Description Melaleuca comboynensis is a small shrub or tree growing to 0.3–5 m (1–20 ft) tall with hard bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 27–95 mm (1–4 in) long, 7–17 mm (0.3–0.7 in) wide, flat, narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end near the base and with the end tapering to a point.[3][4] The flowers are arranged in spikes usually near the end of the branches. The spikes are up to 65 mm (3 in) long and wide with 15 to 50 individual flowers. The petals are 3.0–6.1 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long and fall off as the flower ages. There are 31 to 41 stamens in each flower, with their ""stalks"" (the filaments) red to crimson and ""tips"" (the anthers) a dark purple. Flowering occurs from March to December and is followed by fruit that are woody capsules, 4.1–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long.[3][4] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca comboynensis was first named in 2006 by Lyndley Craven in Novon.[5][6] It was first formally described in 1943 as Callistemon comboynensis by Edwin Cheel in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. His specimen was collected in the ""Comboyne Ranges in crevices of rocks"".[7][8] The specific epithet (comboynensis) refers to the location where the type specimen was found.[3] Callistemon comboynensis is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca comboynensis by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.[9] Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in the high country in and between the Border Ranges in southern Queensland and the Gibraltar Range in northern New South Wales. It also occurs in the lower Murray River districts of north-western Victoria and south-eastern South Australia.[3] It mostly grows on rocky hilltops and crevices above 500 metres (2,000 ft).[4] Use in horticulture Melaleuca comboynensis is well known in cultivation as an attractive and hardy shrub for temperate areas.[3][10] References","Melaleuca comboynensis is a small shrub or tree growing to 0.3–5 m (1–20 ft) tall with hard bark.

 Melaleuca flavovirens, commonly known as green bottlebrush is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to a small area near the New South Wales–Queensland border in Australia. (Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon flavovirens.)[2] It is a stiff shrub, distinguished by its silvery new growth and spikes of greenish flowers with yellow tips.
 Description Melaleuca flavovirens is a spreading shrub growing to 1–3 m (3–10 ft) tall with hard, corrugated bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 36–102 mm (1–4 in) long, 4–11 mm (0.2–0.4 in) wide, narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, and a short, blunt tip on the end. They are also distinguished by their broad v-shape, distinct oil glands on both surfaces, a mid-rib and 8 to 16 distinct lateral veins.[3][4][5] 
The flowers are whitish through cream to green and arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering as well as on the sides of the branches. The spikes are up to 55 mm (2 in) in diameter with 15 to 40 individual flowers. The petals are 3.9–6.1 mm (0.15–0.24 in) long and fall off as the flower ages. There are 34 to 38 stamens in each flower, tipped with yellow. Flowering occurs between May and December and is followed by fruit that are woody capsules, 5.7–8.2 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long.[3][4][5] Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1925 by  Edwin Cheel, who gave it the name Callistemon rugulosus var. flavo-virens. The description was published in Illustrations of New South Wales Plants.[6] In 1925, Cheel raised the variety to species level and gave it the name Callistemon flavovirens, publishing the change in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales.[7][8] In 2006, Lyndley Craven changed the name to Melaleuca flavovirens, publishing the change in Novon.[9][10] The specific epithet (flavovirens) is from the Latin words flavus meaning ""yellow"" and virens meaning ""green"", referring to the colour of the stamens.[3] Callistemon flavovirens is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca flavovirens by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.[11] Distribution and habitat Melaleuca flavovirens occurs in the mountains and tablelands from the Stanthorpe and Wallangarra districts in Queensland south to Torrington and the Guy Fawkes River National Park in northern New South Wales. It grows in scrubland, heath and forest along watercourses and amongst boulders on hilltops.[3][4] Conservation status Melaleuca flavovirens, as Callistemon flavovirens, is classified in New South Wales as a ""Rare or Threatened Australian Plant"".[4] Use in horticulture Melaleuca flavovirens is a drought resistant species but will tolerate wet situations and is tolerant of frosts.

 Melaleuca linearis, commonly known as narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. It is a medium-sized shrub with narrow leaves with a rigid point, and red flower spikes in late spring or early summer.
 Description Melaleuca linearis is a shrub growing to 3 metres (10 ft) tall with grey, hard, fibrous bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 35–115 millimetres (1–5 in) long, 0.7–2.7 millimetres (0.03–0.1 in) wide, narrow linear in shape and flat to channelled or semi-circular in cross section. There is a mid-vein but the lateral veins are inconspicuous.[2][3][4] The flowers are a shade of red, rarely green and arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering and also on the sides of the branches. The spikes are 40–65 millimetres (2–3 in) in diameter and 5–10 centimetres (2.0–3.9 in) long with 20 to 90 individual flowers. The petals are 3.2–7 millimetres (0.1–0.3 in) long and fall off as the flower ages and there are 23–73 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs from late spring to early summer and is followed by fruits that are woody capsules, 3.8–8.2 millimetres (0.1–0.3 in) long.[2][3][4] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca linearis was first formally described in 1796 by Heinrich Schrader and Johann Christoph Wendland in Sertum Hannoveranum.[5][6] The specific epithet (linearis) is a Latin word linearis meaning ""linear""[7] in reference to the shape of the leaves of this species.[2] In 2006, Craven described two varieties of Melaleuca linearis in the journal Novon:
 Plants of the World Online regards Callistemon linearis as a synonym of M. linearis,[10]C. pinifolius as a synonym of M. linearis var. acerosa (although this variety, named by Tausch has not been formally described)[11] and C. rigidus as a synonym of M. linearis var. linearis.[12] It further considers M. linearis var. pinifolia to be a synonym of M. linearis var. acerosa.[13] However, the National Herbarium of New South Wales retains the names Callistemon linearis,[14]Callistemon pinifolius[15] and Callistemon rigidus.[16] The Australian Plant Census considers M. linearis to be a synonym of C. linearis,[17]M. linearis var. pinifolia a synonym of C. pinifolius,[18] and C. rigidus a synonym of C. linearis.[19] A 2012 paper in the journal Muelleria suggested that if Callistemon were to be subsumed into Melaleuca, there would be ""no morphological characters to uniquely define it (Melaluca)"".[20] Indeed, in a 2014 paper in Taxon, Craven and others proposed transferring Beaufortia, Calothamnus, Conothamnus, Eremaea, Lamarchea, Phymatocarpus and Regelia to Melaleuca, a change largely accepted by Plants of the World Online, but not by any Australian authority.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27] (Plants of the World Online considers Regelia to be a synonym of Verschaffeltia.)
[28] Distribution and habitat Melaleuca linearis occurs in and between the south-east corner of Queensland, Nowra on the south coast of New South Wales and inland as far as Gilgandra. It grows in damp situations in a range of vegetation associations.[2][3] Use in horticulture Melaleuca linearis has long been in cultivation (as Callistemon linearis, C. pinifolius and C. rigidus). Although not common in gardens, it is a hardy plant, thriving in most soils but preferring full sun. It is more resistant to pests such as sawfly than other melaleucas.[4][29] It has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[30] References External links","Melaleuca linearis is a shrub growing to 3 metres (10 ft) tall with grey, hard, fibrous bark.

 Plants of the World Online regards Callistemon linearis as a synonym of M. linearis,[10]C. pinifolius as a synonym of M. linearis var. acerosa (although this variety, named by Tausch has not been formally described)[11] and C. rigidus as a synonym of M. linearis var. linearis.[12] It further considers M. linearis var. pinifolia to be a synonym of M. linearis var. acerosa.[13] However, the National Herbarium of New South Wales retains the names Callistemon linearis,[14]Callistemon pinifolius[15] and Callistemon rigidus.[16] The Australian Plant Census considers M. linearis to be a synonym of C. linearis,[17]M. linearis var. pinifolia a synonym of C. pinifolius,[18] and C. rigidus a synonym of C. linearis.[19] A 2012 paper in the journal Muelleria suggested that if Callistemon were to be subsumed into Melaleuca, there would be ""no morphological characters to uniquely define it (Melaluca)"".[20] Indeed, in a 2014 paper in Taxon, Craven and others proposed transferring Beaufortia, Calothamnus, Conothamnus, Eremaea, Lamarchea, Phymatocarpus and Regelia to Melaleuca, a change largely accepted by Plants of the World Online, but not by any Australian authority.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27] (Plants of the World Online considers Regelia to be a synonym of Verschaffeltia.)

 Callistemon megalongensis (Craven & S.M.Douglas) Udovicic & R.D.Spencer
 Melaleuca megalongensis, commonly known as Megalong Valley bottlebrush,[2] is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to New South Wales. (Some Australian state herbaria use the name Callistemon megalongensis).[3] It is a shrub similar to Melaleuca citrina (Callistemon citrinus) which occurs in the same area and is difficult to distinguish from it, except when in flower.  Description Melaleuca megalongensis is a shrub growing to 5 m (20 ft) tall with soft, flaking or peeling bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 35–55 mm (1–2 in) long, 3.5–5 mm (0.1–0.2 in) wide, flat, narrow elliptic to narrow egg-shaped with the narrow end towards the base. There is a mid-vein and 15 to 24 lateral veins. The leaves usually have some thickening at the mid-vein and margins.[4][5][6] The flowers are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and are 30–40 mm (1–2 in) in diameter with 25 to 60 individual flowers. The petals are 3.0–3.7 mm (0.12–0.15 in) long and fall off as the flower ages and there are 45-50 stamens in each flower. The filaments of the stamens are pink with a dark red anther. Flowering occurs in November and December and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, 6 mm (0.2 in) long.[4][5][6] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca megalongensis was first formally described in 2009 by Lyndley Craven in Novon.[7][8] The specific epithet (megalongensis) refers to the locality where the species is found.[4] Callistemon megalongensis is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca megalongensis by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew,[9] Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in the Megalong Valley in the Blue Mountains.

 Melaleuca pallida, commonly known as lemon bottlebrush, is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to eastern Australia. (Some Australian state herbaria use the name Callistemon pallidus.)[2] It is an upright shrub with thin, spreading branches, silvery new growth and pale yellow, sometimes pinkish bottlebrush flowers.
 Description Melaleuca pallida is a shrub or tree growing to 8 m (30 ft) tall, with fibrous or papery bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 20–79 mm (0.8–3 in) long, 4–17 mm (0.2–0.7 in) wide, flat or broadly v-shaped, narrow elliptic to egg-shaped with the narrow end towards the base and with a small point at the end. There is a distinct mid-vein, 6-16 indistinct side veins and many distinct oil glands.[3][4][5] 
The flowers are a shade of cream to yellow, occasionally pinkish-red and are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering and sometimes also on the sides of the branches. The spikes are 20–45 mm (0.8–2 in) in diameter with 15 to 50 individual flowers. The petals are 2.9–6 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long and fall off as the flower ages and there are 34–70 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs from October to February and is followed by fruit that are woody, cup-shaped capsules, 3.9–6.6 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long.[3][4][5] Taxonomy and naming The lemon bottlebrush was first formally described in 1816 by Aimé Bonpland, who gave it the name Metrosideros pallida and published the description in Description des plantes rares cultivées à Malmaison et à Navarre.[6][7] In 1828, de Candolle changed the name to Callistemon pallidus[8] and in 2006 Lyndley Craven changed the name to Melaleuca pallida.[9][10] The specific epithet (pallida) is a Latin word meaning “pale”[11] referring to the pale flower colour.[3] Callistemon pallidus is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca pallida by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.[12] Distribution and habitat Melaleuca pallida occurs from the Border Ranges area in far south eastern Queensland, through the ranges and slopes of New South Wales to eastern Victoria.

 Callistemon pauciflorus R.D.Spencer & Lumley
 Melaleuca faucicola commonly known as desert bottlebrush, is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the Northern Territory in Australia. (Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon pauciflorus.)[2] It is a shrub or small tree growing only in protected gorges in the ranges of Central Australia such as the Petermann Ranges and has red, cream or white spikes of flowers.
 Description Melaleuca faucicola is a shrub growing to 1.515 m (5 ft) tall with hard, fissured bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 25–89 mm (1–4 in) long, 3.5–16 mm (0.1–0.6 in) wide, flat, linear to lance-shaped, with a mid-vein, 16 to 20 lateral veins and distinct oil glands.[3] The flowers red, pink, cream or white. They are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering and also on the sides of the branches. The spikes are up to 27 mm (1 in) in diameter with 7 to 17 individual flowers. The petals are 2.5–4.4 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long and fall off as the flower ages. There are 52 to 71 stamens in each flower, some of which are joined in bundles. Flowering occurs at unpredictable times throughout the year and is followed by fruit that are woody capsules, 2.8–4.5 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long.[3] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca faucicola was named in 2006 by Lyndley Craven in Novon.[4][5] It had previously been known as Callistemon pauciflorus since Roger David Spencer and Peter F. Lumley first formally described it in 1986 in Muelleria from a specimen collected from the ""Serpentine Gorge in the Heavitree Range"".[6] The specific epithet (faucicola) is from the Latin  faux meaning “throat”, hence ""gorge"", and -cola meaning ""dweller in"", referring to the habitat of this species, being in gorge country.[3] Callistemon pauciflorus is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca faucicola by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.[7] Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in the Central Ranges, MacDonnell Ranges and Petermann Ranges in the Northern Territory,[8] where it grows near waterholes in protected sandstone gorges.[3] Conservation status Melaleuca faucicola is classified as ""near threatened"" in terms of the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act.[9] References","Melaleuca faucicola is a shrub growing to 1.515 m (5 ft) tall with hard, fissured bark.

 Callistemon pearsonii R.D.Spencer & Lumley
 Melaleuca pearsonii, commonly known as Blackdown bottlebrush, is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to Queensland in Australia. (Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon pearsonii.)[2] It is a small, spreading but compact shrub with hard bark, soft foliage and profuse spikes of bottlebrush flowers in spring and summer.
 Description Melaleuca pearsonii is a shrub growing to 2 m (7 ft) high and wide, with hard, fibrous bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 14–38 mm (0.6–1 in) long, 1.5–5 mm (0.06–0.2 in) wide, flat, linear to narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base. The leaf veins are indistinct but there are many distinct oil glands.[3][4] The flowers are red, tipped with yellow and are arranged in short spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and also on the sides of the branches. The spikes are 45–65 mm (2–3 in) in diameter with 20 to 40 individual flowers. The petals are 3.7–5.7 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long and fall off as the flower ages and there are 25-39 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs mainly in spring and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, 3.8–5.2 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long.[3][4][5] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca pearsonii was first named in 2006 by Lyndley Craven in Novon when Callistemon pearsonii was moved to the present genus.[6][7] It had previously been known as Callistemon pearsonii, formally described by Roger Spencer and Peter Lumley in 1986 in Muelleria, based on plant material collected from the Blackdown Tabeland. The specific epithet (pearsonii) honours Steven Pearson, a park ranger in the Blackdown Tableland National Park.[3] Callistemon pearsonii is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca pearsonii by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.[8] Distribution and habitat Melaleuca pearsonii occurs on the Blackdown Tableland in Queensland. It grows near rivers, in rocky gullies and in wallum vegetation in creek beds.[3] Use in horticulture Melaleuca pearsonii is sometimes cultivated as Callistemon pearsonii including the cultivar ""Rocky Rambler"".

 Callistemon phoeniceus  Lindl.
 Melaleuca phoenicea, commonly known as scarlet bottlebrush or lesser bottlebrush, is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. (Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon phoeniceus.)[2] The Noongar peoples know the plant as tubada.[3] It is a shrub with thick, blue-green leaves and spikes of scarlet bottlebrush flowers in spring and summer.
 Description Melaleuca phoenicea is a large shrub or small tree growing to 6 m (20 ft) high. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 31–114 mm (1–4 in) long, 3–10 mm (0.1–0.4 in) wide, flat and linear to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base. The leaves are thick and bluish-green and have a mid-vein, 11–18 indistinct lateral veins and prominent oil glands.[4][5][6] 
The flowers are brilliant red or rich scarlet and are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering and also on the sides of the branches. The spikes are 50–65 mm (2–3 in) in diameter with 15 to 55 individual flowers. The petals are 2.9–7.3 mm (0.1–0.3 in) long and fall off as the flower ages. There are 39–56 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs mainly from October to January but also at other times of the year and is followed by fruit that are woody capsules, 4.3–6 mm (0.17–0.24 in) long.[4][5][6] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca phoenicea was first named in 2006 by Lyndley Craven in Novon when Callistemon phoeniceus was transferred to the present genus.[7][8] It had been formally described in 1839 by botanist John Lindley in ""A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony"" as Callistemon phoeniceum, later revised to Callistemon phoeniceus. The specific epithet (phoenicea) is from the Latin word phoeniceus, in turn derived from the Ancient Greek word phoinix meaning ""purple-red"",[9] referring to the flower colour.[4] Callistemon phoeniceus is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca phoenicea by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.[10] Distribution and habitat This melaleuca grows in the south west of Western Australia but there are also scattered populations in some of the more arid areas of that state.[4] It grows in sandy soils, often along watercourses.[11][12] Use in horticulture Melaleuca phoenicea is often cultivated as Callistemon phoeniceus. It is hardy and will grow in most soils provided there is adequate moisture and exposure to the sun. It benefits from light pruning and the application of fertiliser.[6][13] References","Melaleuca phoenicea is a large shrub or small tree growing to 6 m (20 ft) high.

 Melaleuca linearis, commonly known as narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. It is a medium-sized shrub with narrow leaves with a rigid point, and red flower spikes in late spring or early summer.
 Description Melaleuca linearis is a shrub growing to 3 metres (10 ft) tall with grey, hard, fibrous bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 35–115 millimetres (1–5 in) long, 0.7–2.7 millimetres (0.03–0.1 in) wide, narrow linear in shape and flat to channelled or semi-circular in cross section. There is a mid-vein but the lateral veins are inconspicuous.[2][3][4] The flowers are a shade of red, rarely green and arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering and also on the sides of the branches. The spikes are 40–65 millimetres (2–3 in) in diameter and 5–10 centimetres (2.0–3.9 in) long with 20 to 90 individual flowers. The petals are 3.2–7 millimetres (0.1–0.3 in) long and fall off as the flower ages and there are 23–73 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs from late spring to early summer and is followed by fruits that are woody capsules, 3.8–8.2 millimetres (0.1–0.3 in) long.[2][3][4] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca linearis was first formally described in 1796 by Heinrich Schrader and Johann Christoph Wendland in Sertum Hannoveranum.[5][6] The specific epithet (linearis) is a Latin word linearis meaning ""linear""[7] in reference to the shape of the leaves of this species.[2] In 2006, Craven described two varieties of Melaleuca linearis in the journal Novon:
 Plants of the World Online regards Callistemon linearis as a synonym of M. linearis,[10]C. pinifolius as a synonym of M. linearis var. acerosa (although this variety, named by Tausch has not been formally described)[11] and C. rigidus as a synonym of M. linearis var. linearis.[12] It further considers M. linearis var. pinifolia to be a synonym of M. linearis var. acerosa.[13] However, the National Herbarium of New South Wales retains the names Callistemon linearis,[14]Callistemon pinifolius[15] and Callistemon rigidus.[16] The Australian Plant Census considers M. linearis to be a synonym of C. linearis,[17]M. linearis var. pinifolia a synonym of C. pinifolius,[18] and C. rigidus a synonym of C. linearis.[19] A 2012 paper in the journal Muelleria suggested that if Callistemon were to be subsumed into Melaleuca, there would be ""no morphological characters to uniquely define it (Melaluca)"".[20] Indeed, in a 2014 paper in Taxon, Craven and others proposed transferring Beaufortia, Calothamnus, Conothamnus, Eremaea, Lamarchea, Phymatocarpus and Regelia to Melaleuca, a change largely accepted by Plants of the World Online, but not by any Australian authority.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27] (Plants of the World Online considers Regelia to be a synonym of Verschaffeltia.)
[28] Distribution and habitat Melaleuca linearis occurs in and between the south-east corner of Queensland, Nowra on the south coast of New South Wales and inland as far as Gilgandra. It grows in damp situations in a range of vegetation associations.[2][3] Use in horticulture Melaleuca linearis has long been in cultivation (as Callistemon linearis, C. pinifolius and C. rigidus). Although not common in gardens, it is a hardy plant, thriving in most soils but preferring full sun. It is more resistant to pests such as sawfly than other melaleucas.[4][29] It has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[30] References External links","Melaleuca linearis is a shrub growing to 3 metres (10 ft) tall with grey, hard, fibrous bark.

 Melaleuca pityoides, commonly known as alpine bottlebrush,[2] is a plant in the family Myrtaceae, and is endemic to the higher areas of south eastern Australia. Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon pityoides.[3] It is a shrub, often occurring in dense thickets, with hard bark, silvery-grey new growth, almost cylindrical leaves and spikes of flowers that are usually a shade of yellow.
 Description Melaleuca pityoides is a shrub growing to 3 m (10 ft) high and wide, with hard grey bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 12–24 mm (0.5–0.9 in) long, 0.5–2.5 mm (0.02–0.1 in) wide, flat to almost cylindrical in cross section, very narrow elliptic to egg-shaped, ending in a sharp point. The leaf veins and oil glands are indistinct. The young leaves and branches are often densely covered with silky hairs.[2][4][5][6][7][8] The flowers are golden-yellow to cream, sometimes tinged with pink or green, and are arranged in short spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The spikes are 18–25 mm (0.7–1 in) in diameter and 100 mm (4 in) long with 10 to 15 individual flowers. The petals are 2.1–3.4 mm (0.08–0.1 in) long and fall off as the flower ages and there are 32-52 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs from October to February, sometimes in other months and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, 3.2–5.1 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long.[2][4][5][7] Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1883 by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller, who gave it the name Callistemon pityoides in Australian Chemist and Druggist, based on material gathered from the environs of the Ovens River and ""Dumaresque River"".[9][10] He first mentioned Melaleuca pithyoides without description in 1853 in his First General Report of the Government Botanist on the Vegetation of the Colony in 1853.[11] Mueller had collected non-flowering plant material from Mount Buffalo on an expedition earlier that year.[12][13] The name was changed to Melaleuca pityoides in 2006 by Lyndley Craven in Novon.[12][14] The specific epithet (pityoides) is from the Greek pitys meaning “pine”[15]: 609  and εἶδος (eîdos) meaning ""likeness”,[15]: 346  referring to the similarity of the leaves of this species with those of some kinds of pine trees.[4] Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs from the Border Ranges district in the far south east of Queensland, south through the Northern, Central and Southern Tablelands of New South Wales and the highlands of eastern Victoria. It grows in swampy heath and rocky streams, often forming thickets to the exclusion of other species.[4][2][5][6] Use in horticulture Melaleuca pityoides is sometimes cultivated as Callistemon pityoides. It grows well in cold climates, including in the United Kingdom, preferring heavier soils and can tolerate poor drainage.[7] References","Melaleuca pityoides is a shrub growing to 3 m (10 ft) high and wide, with hard grey bark.

 Callistemon polandii F.M.Bailey
 Melaleuca polandii, commonly known as gold-tipped bottlebrush, is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic a small area in far northern Queensland in Australia. (Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon polandii.)[2] It is a dense shrub with bronze-coloured, hairy new growth and spikes of red flowers tipped with yellow.
 Description Melaleuca polandii is a shrub growing to 4 m (10 ft) high. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 63–129 mm (2–5 in) long, 16–35 mm (0.6–1 in) wide, flat, narrow egg-shaped and tapering to a point. The leaves have a distinct mid-vein and 19 to 25 lateral veins. The young leaves and branches are covered with fine, silky hairs.[3][4] The flowers are bright red and are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering and sometimes in the upper leaf axils. The spikes are 50–60 mm (2.0–2.4 in) in diameter. The petals are 3.6–5.3 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long, fall off as the flower ages and there are 35-50 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs from late winter to summer, sometimes in other months and is followed by fruit that are woody capsules, 4.6–6.5 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long.[3][4] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca polandii was first named in 2006 by Lyndley Craven in Novon when Callistemon polandii was transferred to the present genus.[5][6]Callistemon polandii was first formally described in 1902 by Frederick Manson Bailey from a specimen collected in ""Bloomfield River [by] Rev. W. Poland"". The specific epithet (polandii) honours Wilhelm Poland, a missionary at Wujal Wujal (formerly the Bloomfield River Mission).[3][7] Callistemon polandii is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca polandii by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.[8] Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in the Cape Flattery and Cooktown districts of Queensland where it grows in dense wallum heath in sandy or peaty soils.[3] Use in horticulture Melaleuca polandii is a hardy shrub, suitable for warm coastal areas. It is useful as a screen or hedge but is known to damage wastewater pipes.[4][9] References","Melaleuca polandii is a shrub growing to 4 m (10 ft) high.

 Callistemon pungens Lumley & R.D.Spencer
 Melaleuca williamsii is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to an area between north-eastern New South Wales and south eastern Queensland in Australia. (Some Australian state herbaria continue use the name Callistemon pungens.)[2] It is a distinctive shrub with stiff branches, silvery new growth, prickly leaves and spikes of purple flowers in late spring. It is classified as a vulnerable species under the Australian Government Endangered Species Protection Act.
 Description Melaleuca williamsii is a shrub growing to 2.5 m (8 ft) tall with rigid branches and new growth covered with soft, silky hairs giving a silvery appearance. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are 18–68 mm (0.7–3 in) long, 3–14 mm (0.1–0.6 in) wide, narrow elliptic to narrow egg-shaped and flat to half-moon shaped in cross section. They have a sharp tip 1–2 mm (0.04–0.08 in) long, a mid vein, indistinct lateral veins and oil glands visible on both surfaces.[3][4][5][6] The flowers are deep red, white, or a shade of pink to purple. They are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The spikes are up to 25–45 mm (1–2 in) in diameter and 50–60 mm (2.0–2.4 in) long with 10 to 65 individual flowers. The petals are 2.1–5.8 mm (0.08–0.2 in) long and fall off as the flower ages and there are 25 to 66 stamens per flower. Flowering occurs from October to December and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, 3.9–6.6 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long.[3][4][5][6] Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca williamsii was first named in 2009 by Lyndley Craven in Novon when Callistemon pungens was transferred to the present genus.[7][8] It had previously been known as Callistemon pungens, first formally described by Roger Spencer and Peter Lumley in 1990 in Muelleria, based on plant material collected from near Hillgrove.[9] The specific epithet (williamsii) honours John Beaumont Williams, a botanist who was expert in the flora of the Northern Tablelands region of New South Wales.[3] There are three subspecies:
 Callistemon pungens is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca williamsii by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.[13] Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in the higher altitude regions of north eastern New South Wales and south eastern Queensland. It grows in granite and trachyte rock crevices in forest and heath and on sandy or shallow rocky soil.[3][4] Conservation Melaleuca williamsii (as Callistemon pungens) has been classified as ""vulnerable"" by the Scientific Committee of the NSW Government Department of Environment and Heritage[5] and by the Australian Government Department of the Environment.[6] References","Melaleuca williamsii is a shrub growing to 2.5 m (8 ft) tall with rigid branches and new growth covered with soft, silky hairs giving a silvery appearance.
