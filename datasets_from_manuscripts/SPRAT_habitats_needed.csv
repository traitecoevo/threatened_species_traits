Prostanthera eurybioides,"The Monarto mintbush is endemic to South Australia (SA) and has a restricted distribution in two disjunct localities in the south-east of SA: in Monarto near Murray Bridge, and in the Mt Monster area near Keith (Map 1). It is found in the Kanmantoo bioregion, a biodiversity hotspot (Environment SA n.d.). Given the specific habitat requirements of this species, it is likely that there are few unknown subpopulations, though some subpopulations on private property may remain undiscovered (Pound et al. 2010). As of 2010, it was estimated that the total population has approximately 2233 individuals, consisting of 1216 naturally occurring plants and 1017 translocated plants (Pound et al. 2010). As of 2018, the total population was estimated at 2084 individuals, consisting of 1250 naturally occurring plants and 834 translocated plants (Moritz et al. 2018). Translocations of the Monarto mintbush have occurred as the result of numerous projects since at least 1995 (Jusaitis 2010; Pound et al. 2010; Jusaitis 2018; Moritz et al. 2018). The majority of these translocations have been either reinforcement (supplemental) or reintroduction translocations (sensu IUCN SSC 2013). In order to be counted as part of the wild population for the purpose of listing assessments, translocated plants must have survived for at least 5 years and have produced mature offspring (or offspring that are likely to reach maturity) (IUCN SPC 2022). Many translocated Monarto mintbush plants have produced viable seed and seedlings, especially at Mt Monster, while some at Monarto have only flowered with no signs of natural recruitment (Jusaitis 2010). However, large quantities of viable seed were produced at Monarto in 2017 (Moritz et al. 2018). More recent translocations have not been included in population counts (DEW 2021).

Monarto area Moritz et al. (2018) estimated that there are approximately 909 individuals within the general Monarto area, including 682 translocated (planted) individuals. Some Monarto sites have been supplemented with planted individuals (reinforcement), and others consist only of planted individuals (reintroduction) (Moritz et al. 2018). Supplementary plantings began in 1995, as part of a study focussing on the impact of fencing on the survival of seedlings (Jusaitis 2010). In 2003, State Flora Murray Bridge planted approximately 1000 individuals at Rocky Gully Reserve, however by 2005 only 452 of these remained (Obst 2005; Pound et al. 2010). Other sites included 130 individuals planted within the grounds of Monarto Zoo, 67 in the south-western

portion of a Heritage Agreement at Monarto (Jusaitis & Smith 1999) and 196 that were translocated to Section 530 in the Hundred of Monarto (see SA OSG 1979) (Jusaitis et al. 1998). Subsequent translocations from 2013 to 2015 resulted in 218 plants surviving after 2 years, with a 52% survival rate and 70% of surviving individuals flowering (Moritz et al. 2018).

The remnant subpopulation of Monarto mintbush at Monarto has remained relatively stable between 2004 and 2020, apart from one small property, where numbers reduced dramatically over time (DEW 2021). It is notable that these are very small remnants that were left with grazing and no active management (other than weed control). During this period, the largest natural subpopulation saw a small reduction in numbers from 143 plants to 139 plants, which was supplemented with a small amount of planting (DEW 2021). Significant mortality of planted individuals was observed in Kinchina Conservation Park, which dropped from 461 plants to 73 plants (DEW 2021). However, this is likely a result of poor planting location. These plants were planted into an open area, where they have been subject to high grazing pressure (DEW 2021). This unfavourable environment is likely the cause of lack of recruitment (DEW 2021).

It is notable that these subpopulation figures (Table 1) do not include other more recent plantings at Monarto, some of which are reported to be doing very well (DEW 2021). These sites have not been included in official subpopulation counts as no decision has been made as to at what age to count them (for example, which time since planting/survival/flowering is the correct time to add to databases) (DEW 2021).

Mt Monster A February 2007 survey of the Mt Monster area found approximately 1175 individuals, with subpopulations occurring within the Mt Monster Conservation Park and surrounding areas including Christmas Rocks, Kongal Rocks and Monster Rock (Johnson, pers comm 2007 cited in

Pound et al. 2010). Of this total, Pound et al. (2010) estimated that 1023 plants were naturally occurring and 152 individuals were planted. The planted individuals are the survivors of 182 plants propagated from locally collected seed which were translocated during 1997 and 1998 to Christmas Rocks, Kongal Rocks and the southern boundary of Mt Monster Conservation Park (Jusaitis & Smith 1999). In 2018, the Mt Monster subpopulation was again estimated to consist of 1175 individuals, including 152 which had been planted (Moritz et al. 2018).
