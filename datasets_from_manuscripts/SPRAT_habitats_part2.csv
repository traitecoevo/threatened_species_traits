Symonanthus bancroftii, t grows in an area of disturbed shallow granitic soil which is prone to hard setting Rob Buehrig 1997 suggests that Symonanthus bancroftii may prefer a residualcolluvial soil derived from granitic rocks Beyond this the clues as to its typical habitat are conflicting The plant may naturally grow immediately adjacent to granite outcrops or may grow close to drainagelines lower down in the landscape The remnant vegetation at the known site is woodland ,,,,,,,,,drainages rocky_outcrop,drainagelines outcrops,disturbed outcrop woodland,disturbed outcrops woodland,,,granitic,granite granitic,,,,
